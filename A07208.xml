            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>And firſt by his example, for when hee heard one of

the company proclaiming with a loud voice the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe of that woman who had bred and brought up ſuch a ſonne; he taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hereby to diſcourſe of the true bleſſedneſſe indeed which farre exceedeth all ſuch bleſſings, as the breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bearing of a good ſonne is: teaching us by this practice of his, how to make that uſe of ordinary occurrences in the world, which may ſtirre up our hearts to think on, and to ſeeke after the things that are above; which is a good ſtep toward the bleſſedneſſe of heaven and eternall life.</p>
                     <p>And ſecondly our Lord teacheth us the way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe more fully by his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2455:11"/>
doctrine here delivered; in which wee finde him telling us, that the true bleſſedneſſe ariſeth out of piety and Gods ſervice, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſet out in Gods word, and may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto us by our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and keeping of that word. All which points briefely and ſummarily ſet downe in our Saviours words, I intend by Gods grace to enlarge and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſtill laying the ground of my diſcourſe in the ſacred Text: hoping by my poore labours in this argument, I may ſomewhat further both my ſelfe and others, to the obtaining of that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which wee all doe ſo much ſeeke after. That God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2455:11"/>
which hath put this thought into my heart, put that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into my words, that they may guide ſome ſoule or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eternall life.</p>
                     <p>But before I enter upon the propoſed points, it will be neceſſary firſt to unfold the Text: that ſo both our Lords doctrines &amp; my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the more plainely.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion of this ſpeech was this: Our Lord had beene preaching the Kingdome of God to the people; and a <hi>woman of the company</hi> raviſhed with the gratious words, that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him, brake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his praiſes, in theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps that thou
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2455:12"/>
haſt ſucked:</hi> but this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation given by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, our Lord correcteth in this manner; <hi>Yea rather, bleſſed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which correction of our Saviour, that it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be conceived, wee muſt enquire, what there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in this womans ſpeech, that deſerved a <hi>correction,</hi> and how our Lord did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.</p>
                     <p>And my anſwere thereto I ſet downe in two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Propoſition, There was not any thing ſo amiſſe in this womans ſpeech, as that ſhe may be ſaid either to have committed a ſin, or to have uttered an untruth.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2455:12"/>
For by this word <hi>[bleſſed]</hi> this woman meant not that perfect bleſſedneſſe, which conſiſteth in the fruition of all good; ſuch as our Saviour meant, when he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit: for theirs is the Kingdome of heaven. Mat.</hi> 5.3. but uſing the word in a vulgar ſort, ſhee meant by it a great bleſſing of God beſtowed on Chriſts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in the ſame ſenſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I think my ſelfe happy, King Agrippa, becauſe I ſhall anſwer for my ſelfe this day, before thee, touching all theſe things, whereof I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of the Iews. Act.</hi> 26.2. For as <hi>Paul</hi> by theſe words meant, that he thought it a great bleſſing to himſelfe, that he had ſuch a Judge: ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2455:13"/>
this woman, by her words meant, that ſhe thought it a great bleſſing to Chriſts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſhe had ſuch a ſon. And thus to call her a bleſſed woman, was neither a ſinne, nor an untruth. Firſt it was not an untruth; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The father of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall greatly rejoyce; and he that begetteth a wiſe childe, ſhall have joy of him. Thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thy mother ſhall bee glad; and ſhe that bare thee, ſhall rejoyce. Prov.</hi> 23.24, 25. Where by ſaying, that they ſhall be glad, and ſhall have joy of ſuch a ſonne; hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that he thought this to be a great bleſſing. But <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the very dialect or phraſe of this woman:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2455:13"/>
                        <hi>Children</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage of the Lord, &amp; the fruit of the womb, is his reward.</hi> He meaneth it of good children onely, and of them hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further; <hi>Bleſſed is the man that hath his quiver full of them. Pſal.</hi> 127.3, 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it was no ſinne neither in this woman, that ſhee did thus magnifie the happineſſe of Chriſts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of ſuch a ſon: for <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David</hi> in the places now cited did the like in the ſame caſe, or in a caſe not ſo juſt as this was. And upon theſe grounds I ſay in the firſt place, that there was nothing ſo farre amiſſe in this ſpeech of the woman, as that we can ſay, ſhe either committed a ſinne, or ſpoke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2455:14"/>
an untruth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> There was a defect in this ſpeech, which might bee bettered and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: for elſe our Lord would not have corrected it with a Yea rather. And (to ſpeake particularly) the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect herein was twofold. 1. That ſhee did minde a leſſer bleſſedneſſe, and fixed her thoughts upon that; when ſhee might, but did not, think on a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſedneſſe, then that was, and which concerned her in an higher degree. For it is a kinde of bleſſedneſſe indeed, to have a good and vertuous childe, that may comfort us in the world: but it is a farre greater bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to enjoy a father in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2455:14"/>
heaven, in whoſe preſence is fulneſſe of joy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And if this woman did not ſo eſteeme of this bleſſedneſſe, but with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of it did magnifie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this was a fault that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved reprehenſion; Or if ſhe did upon the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as I ſuppoſe ſhe did, magnifie the happineſſe of having a gratious ſonne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving notwithſtanding her beſt affections for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of heaven: then though ſhee could not bee blamed, yet her ſpeech might be amended. He that calleth them bleſſed, who have godly children, ſaith well; but hee that calleth them bleſſed, who keepe Gods commandements, ſaith
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2455:15"/>
better. And therefore our Lord did amend the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſpeech, by turning it on that bleſſedneſſe, which ſhe had neglected, or at leaſt omitted to ſpeake of. The ſumme of which correction is, as if hee had ſaid, Thou ſayeſt, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb, &amp;c.</hi> Which though I deny not to be true; yet I will tell thee of a farre greater bleſſednes, then that is; <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keep it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This woman made not ſo good an uſe of our Saviours doctrine, as ſhee might have done. When ſhe heard him preach with great wiſdome, and evidence of the Spirit; ſhe brake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the praiſes of the <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:2455:15"/>
which were juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him: but ſhe ſaid nothing, perhaps ſhe thought nothing of <hi>amending</hi> her life, or of performing what ſhe was taught. And herein our Lord amendeth her ſpeech by telling her, what better uſe ſhee might make of his Sermon. Shee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for his good Sermon, when ſhe had done better, if ſhee had amended her ſelfe by his inſtruction. She ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bred ſuch a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; but he ſaid, <hi>Nay rather bleſſed</hi> is the hearer, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of his doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The Text being thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, I now proceed to ſpeake of the points that I propounded; omitting other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2455:16"/>
by-notes, which though they bee profitable in their ſeaſon, yet are not pertinent to my purpoſe.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2455:16"/>
by the mention or ſight of earthly things.</p>
                     <p>My proofes for this are two, the conſtant practice of our Saviour, and the helpes that it yeeldeth us to a godly and an happy life.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The conſtant practice of our Saviour, related and commended to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for there wee reade, that when he ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> buſied in fiſhing, he tooke occaſion by the trade that then they did uſe, to tell them of an heavenly trade of fiſhing for the ſouls of men. <hi>He ſaw them caſting a net into the Sea, (for they were fiſhers:) and he ſaid unto them, follow mee, and I will make you fiſhers of men. Mat.</hi> 4.18, 19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:2455:17"/>Againe, when ſome told him of his mother and his brethren, deſiring to ſpeake with him, he tooke occaſion from the mention of his earthly kindred to inſtruct us in the ſpirituall kindred, that is betweene him and every good Chriſtian. <hi>It was told him by certain, which ſaid, Thy mother and thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſtand without, deſiring to ſee thee. And hee anſwered and ſaid unto them, My mother and my brethren are theſe, which heare the word of God and doe it. Luke</hi> 8.20, 21.</p>
                     <p>And againe, when the woman of Samaria came to draw water out of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well; out of this accident he fetcheth occaſion to inſtruct her in the living water, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2455:17"/>
would refreſh her ſoule unto eternall life. <hi>There commeth a woman of Samaria to draw water: Ieſus ſaith unto her, give me to drinke.—Then ſaid the woman; how is it that thou being a Iew, askeſt drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? —Ieſus anſwered and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drinke; thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.—Of which water whoſoever drinketh, ſhal never thirſt: but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall bee in him a well of water, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into everlaſting life. Ioh.</hi> 4.7, 9, 14.</p>
                     <p>And yet againe, when the people followed after him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2455:18"/>
that they might eate of his bread; he taketh occaſion from their deſire of earthly meate, to inſtruct them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bread of life. When the people came to Capernaum ſeeking for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus— <hi>Ieſus anſwered them and ſaid, verily, verily I ſay vnto you, Ye ſeeke mee, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. Labour not for the meate which periſheth, but for that meate, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life. Iohn</hi> 6.26, 27.</p>
                     <p>Thus our Saviour by a conſtant cuſtome, taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the words that are ſpoken, and occurrences that happen in the world, to raiſe mens thoughts from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2455:18"/>
earth to heaven: and from things that concerne this life to teach them ſpirituall leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for obtaining of eternal life. By which practice of his, hee lifteth up men to heaven, while they remaine upon earth; and breedeth in them heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, while they are occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about their worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And this being his conſtant practice who is the wiſdome of his father; it proveth the truth of my concluſion, that it is a point of holy wiſdome to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for heavenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the mention or ſight of earthly things.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſame point is further proved by the helps that we may receive from it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2455:19"/>
towards holineſſe and an happy life. In which kinde I may reckon theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It will make every creature that we ſee, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very occurrence that wee meet with in the world, to ſerve us as <hi>Schoolemaſters</hi> to lead us unto Chriſt; and as a Monitor to remember us of ſome duty. The meat on our tables will teach us the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the meate that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſheth; and our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after that will admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſh us how wee ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the food of Gods word, that we may grow and bee ſtrengthned in grace by it. The clothes we put on, will remember us of <hi>putting on the Lord Ieſus,</hi> and of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2455:19"/>
robes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, with which Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are adorned. The ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection which we ſhew to our children; will bring to remembrance the great love of our heavenly father towards his ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The duty and ſervice that wee require of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, will tell us, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter duty we owe to our Lord in heaven: and their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings towards us, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us of many defects of our owne in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and of our rebellions againſt his commandments.</p>
                     <p>And the like may be ſaid of all other the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and occurrences: ſo that not a crumme of bread, nor a corne of ſalt, nor a drop of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2455:20"/>
drinke, but as they ſerve to refreſh nature, ſo they may ſerve alſo to increaſe and confirme grace in us. And all the creatures will have not onely a naturall uſe for this life; but alſo a ſpirituall uſe towards eternall life and the happineſſe of the world to come.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This practice of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring holy meditations from worldly occurrences will help to preſerve us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the creatures in a ſinfull ſort. Hee that when he eateth his meate for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of his body, ſhall think withall, Yea, but how much more neceſſary and comfortable is the food of Gods word to the famiſhed ſoule? will not likely abuſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2455:20"/>
the creatures to ſurfetting and exceſſe. And hee that when he putteth on his beſt clothes; ſhall think, Yea, but how much more glorious are the garments of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and the fine linnen and ſilkes, with which the Saints are adorned? that man or that woman will not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proud of a ſilk gowne, or a gold ring, or a beaver hat, or an imbroidered pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoate, or any thing, that fine minions take pride in. And if a man while he is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in his Trade, ſhall think; Yea, but how much more paines ſhould I take to enrich my ſoule with the treaſures of Gods grace? that man will not have the heart to diſhonour God by diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2455:21"/>
gaine. And if a man, when hee exacteth diligent and daily labour from his apprentice or ſervants, and chideth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they be ſlack in his ſervice; ſhall think with himſelfe, Yea, but how much more juſtly may God require all obedience at my hands, and chide and chaſten mee for my great ſlothfulneſſe in ſerving him? that man will never rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſervants with rigor, nor oppreſſe them with too much work, or too little meate. And the like is true in all other the like caſes. And by this meanes we ſhall be kept from a ſinfull abuſe of the creatures, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would bee a great hinderance to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2455:21"/>
and a bleſſed life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame practice will bee a meanes to ſeaſon our hearts with heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, even while wee are going about our worldly occaſions. If wee ſhould at any time forget God and our countrey that is above; every occurrence in this life would remember us of the life to come. When we are at worke in our ſhops, or ſit downe to eate at our boards, or lie downe to reſt on our beds, or walk out to take ayre in the fields; and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we are, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we doe; ſome accident or other would befall us in our way, that would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good thoughts to our mindes and memories. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2455:22"/>
by this meanes we ſhould <hi>have our converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> while we are upon the earth; as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: or, as a learned Writer phraſeth it, we ſhould have <hi>an heaven upon earth:</hi> and ſo in good part we ſhould even in this life enjoy that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which we expect and deſire fully to poſſeſſe in the life to come.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the proofes: the uſes follow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This detecteth the folly &amp; prepoſterous courſe of worldlings, who uſually goe the quite contrary way. The right way, &amp; that which our Lord directeth us to by his example, is, that we uſe the creatures to bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: but theſe men uſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2455:22"/>
God and his ſervice to bring themſelves to their deſires in the world. Such men I meane, who ſhew great for wardneſſe in religion, that they may compaſſe their worldly ends. They pray, and they profeſſe, and they heare Sermons, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine Preachers: but their praying, and their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and their hearing, and their honouring of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, are but as ſo many ſtalking horſes under which they lie hid, till they have caught the prey. It is but a fable (but the moral of it is an evident truth;) which wiſe men tell us of a fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſonne. They ſay of him that he put himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Monaſtery, and there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2455:23"/>
lived as a poore Monke: but being of good parts by na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, and thriving well in his ſtudies, was for his well-deſerving advanced to bee the <hi>Abbot</hi> of the Monaſtery. Which place of dignity whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had obtained, hee, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his poore beginnings, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber himſelfe whoſe ſonne he was; cauſed a <hi>net</hi> to be ſpred upon his table-cloth, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee went to meate. Afterward, for his vertues he was thought fit to be a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;</hi> and then was advanced to bee a <hi>Cardinal.</hi> And ſtill in humility, and in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, the <hi>net</hi> was every day ſpred upon his table. And by this meanes he gained ſuch an op nion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2455:23"/>
of humility and holineſſe, that men thought him not onely worthy of the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he had, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of farre greater; and ſo in concluſion he was choſen to be <hi>Pope.</hi> In which place he lived as a great Lord, but forbore to ſpread the net a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer. And being aſked the reaſon, he anſwered, that now the fiſh was taken for which he had ſpred the <hi>net</hi> all this while: meaning, that now he had gotten the preferment, at which he had ſtill aimed. Beloved bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I ſuppoſe ye wil laugh at the deviſe: and ſome men perhaps will be the better pleaſed with it, becauſe it was framed of a Clergyman. But ſhall I tell you what the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2455:24"/>
Poet ſaid in a like caſe? <hi>[Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato nomine de te fabula narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:]</hi> Change but the name, and the fable fitteth your ſelves. It is not only meant of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> and ſuch hypocriticall <hi>Preachers,</hi> who devoure widdowes and mens houſes too under a ſhew of zealous preaching. But it is meant of <hi>hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call profeſſors</hi> alſo, who ſcarſe ever open their eyes, ſave when they looke up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but it is that they may be thought to be holy &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſuch as mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but heavenly things. And it is meant of <hi>covetous</hi> profeſſors, who frequent ſermons, and pray with their families, and ſet up Lectures abroad, and talk nothing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2455:24"/>
but Scripture phraſe: and all this, that they may draw cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers to their ſhops, or hook-in other mens eſtates into their hands, and breake with the more advantage. And it is meant of <hi>ambitious</hi> profeſſors, who talk ſtill in a popular language, and ſpeak for the good of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and finde fault with the errors in our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and like zealous <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots</hi> indeed, take part with the Commoners againſt their Alderman, and with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne; and all that they may ſteale the hearts of the multitude, and by their voices and votes bee choſen into ſome place of honour, to which they doe aſpire.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2455:25"/>
Againſt all theſe, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who pretend religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and intend their owne ends, was this fable deviſed. They are the men that ſpread the <hi>net,</hi> till the fiſh be taken; and more then that, they minde not. And of all theſe I ſay, they take a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and prepoſterous courſe, becauſe they make religion to ſerve for worldly ends; whereas all worldly things ſhould ſerve the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This is of great uſe for all them, who would ſerve God in ſincerity. For it teacheth them how to gaine zeale and good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards God; not onely by hearing of ſermons and reading of Scriptures, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2455:25"/>
uſing a conſtant courſe in all holy duties; but even by the ordinary occurrences that they meete with in the world. If they follow this courſe, and make uſe of it, they may grow in grace, and gaine holy affections, while they are in their ſhops, and while they walk in the ſtreetes, and while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with their friends, and while they either think or do any thing by themſelves. And this I ſuppoſe may bee a ſufficient motive, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to this practice. And for our better direction in the right uſe of it, learned men have preſcribed us ſome rules, and holy men have left us ſome examples; in whoſe ſteps if wee ſhall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2455:26"/>
tread, we may gaine the like comfort that they have done.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt for rules: <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned as well for piety as learning, among other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned workes of his, hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Treatiſe, which hee calleth <hi>Excitationes animi ad Deum;</hi> that is, <hi>The liftings up of the ſoule unto God.</hi> In this book he preſcribeth us rules of meditation and prayer upon every incidentall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: for example, when we awake out of ſleep in a morning, and finde our ſelves refreſhed by our reſt; then hee biddeth us think, <hi>how joyfull and bleſſed a thing it will be,</hi> to bee raiſed up to eternall life, after our ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2455:26"/>
in the grave; and to pray withall, that as God hath raiſed our bodies from their ſleep, that wee may do the works of this life; ſo hee would raiſe up our ſoules from the ſleep of ſin, that we may do the works of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and a godly life. And when wee are going on a journey; then we ſhould think, that our life here is a <hi>pilgrimage on earth,</hi> in which we are ſeparated from our owne countrey and our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends, that is, from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and the bleſſed ſoules that be there; and then wee ſhould pray, that God will teach us to live here as <hi>pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> and <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> that are travelling toward a better countrey, and that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2455:27"/>
may be in heaven, while our bodily manſion is on earth. And when we ſee a candle lighted in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be a comfort againſt the diſmall darkneſſe of the night; that then we ſhould think, how neceſſary the <hi>knowledge of Gods word is,</hi> which is a light to our eyes, and lanterne to our feete: and pray withall, that God would keep this candle ſtill ſhining before us, that wee may know how to ſerve him aright. The like rules of good thoughts and prayers he preſcribeth us, when we put on our clothes, when we go out of doores, when we ſit down to meate, when we prepare to bedward, and upon other the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2455:27"/>
leaving us no part of the day, nor no occaſion of our life, without ſome holy thoughts, that may make us like to the Saints, that be in heaven. This book of <hi>Vives</hi> and the <hi>meditations</hi> and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> contained in it, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Martyr M. <hi>Bradford</hi> hath tranſlated, or the greateſt part of them into our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tongue, and hath pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſented them to the view of the world, in a book of his, called <hi>Bradfords Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prayers.</hi> And after him, M <hi>Henry Bull,</hi> who hath gathered together many ſweete flowers of ſuch like devotion, hath alſo, for the benefit of his countrey-men printed theſe meditations and prayers among the reſt.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2455:28"/>
There, if ye pleaſe, yee may reade them: and I dare ſay, if ye reade them with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care, you will not think your labour either loſt or ill beſtowed. Beſides theſe books, there is one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of late yeares, penned by a reverend and learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of our Church, called <hi>Occaſionall Meditations.</hi> In it you are directed how on ordinary and triviall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yee may raiſe up your thoughts to heaven-ward. But that book I ſuppoſe, is in the hands of moſt men: and the known worth of the Author will ſufficiently commend it to their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I onely will ſay thus much, that who ſo ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe theſe books, and make
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2455:28"/>
uſe of them accordingly; I doubt not, but he will finde in them good helps to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and great comfort to his ſoule. And ſo I leave the Rules.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The examples, that I make choiſe of for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Examp.</hi> The firſt of one <hi>Pambo,</hi> an ancient and religious man. Of him<note n="*" place="margin">Socrat. hiſt. l. 4 c. 18. pag. 660. Roſw. de vitis Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum l. 3. num. 164 pag. 524. v. etiam l. 1. c. 3. in vita S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagiae. pa. 377. de Nonno Epiſcopo.</note> 
                        <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> reporteth, that ſeeing a light woman finely trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and ſumptuouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, that ſhee might pleaſe, and allure lovers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, hee burſt out into teares, and being aſked why he wept, he gave theſe two reaſons for it. 1. becauſe he ſaw in what miſerable ſtate that woman was in; it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2455:29"/>
him that ſo goodly a creature of Gods making, ſhould be in ſo ready a way to hell and deſtruction: and 2. becauſe, ſaid he, I do not take ſo much paines to pleaſe my good God, as ſhe doth to pleaſe ſinfull men. This example if we wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, we may make uſe of it divers wayes for our good: namely thus; when we ſee a <hi>Porter</hi> ſweating under his burden, that he may earne a poore wages; we may check our own dulneſſe, who are ſo ſoone weary of labouring for an eternall Kingdome; that we grudge to ſpend a quarter of an houre in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or a whole houre in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word, or a day in abſtinence and faſting for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2455:29"/>
our ſins. For what a ſhame is it that a labouring man ſhould willingly take ſo much paines for a teſter or a ſhilling, when we think ſo little paines to be overmuch for obtaining of eternall life and the Kingdome of heaven? And when we ſee a <hi>Shopkeeper</hi> abridge himſelf of his meate and of his ſleep, that hee may attend his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers and make gaine of his trading; wee may juſtly blame our ſelves for our backwardneſſe in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that we cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge our ſelves in our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and in our ſleeping and in our ſporting and in our clothing, that wee may bee the fitter and more expedite for good duties and for the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2455:30"/>
Kingdome of God. And when we ſee a man that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>phyſick,</hi> faſt aforehand, and after the taking of it, to content himſelfe with a thin ſupping, that the medicine may work the better; wee may think every man with himſelfe, what a foole am I, that on the Lords day, when God prepareth and giveth me phyſick for my ſoule, I do ſo fill my ſtomach with meate, and my head with ſtrong drink, as maketh my ſelfe unfit for Gods ſervice, and my praying, and hearing and reading unprofitable for my ſoule? And when wee ſee men and women look the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in the <hi>glaſſe</hi> every day, that they may carie with them no ſpots or defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2455:30"/>
in their faces, that may ſhame them when they goe abroad among men: wee ſhould accuſe our ſhameleſſe ſecurity in matters of our ſoules, and that we doe not examine our conſciences and look our ſoules in the glaſſe of Gods Law, that there bee no deformity in our lives, that may ſhame us before God and his Angels. I might make many ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of <hi>Pamboes</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to our ſelves, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch collections to ſhame our ſelves for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion and want of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: but out of theſe there is direction enough for them that are willing to make uſe of it; &amp; too much for them, who ſhal deſpiſe it.</p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:2455:31"/>2. <hi>Examp.</hi> The ſecond example is of a Cook in a Colledge of religious men.

Which <hi>Climacus</hi> obſerving, importuned him to know by what meanes he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſuch a degree of ſanctitie and holineſſe; and he after ſome intreaties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him to this effect;<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, in this work of the Kitchin, <hi>did never think that I ſerved men, but God,</hi> who enjoyned me true ſervice in my place: <hi>and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelfe unworthy of any reſt</hi> by reaſon of my many
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2455:31"/>
failings, <hi>when I look on this fire in my chimney;</hi> how intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the burning thereof would be to my fleſh, <hi>I am put in minde</hi> of the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and much more unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable <hi>burnings of hell fire,</hi> due to all impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and the thought of this torment doth reſolve me into teares for my ſins.</p>
                     <p>And now if we will make uſe of this example, we ſhall not need to goe abroad, and gather inſtructions from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens lifes, as <hi>Pambo</hi> did: we ſhall finde matter enough at home to exerciſe our thoughts with. For ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample ſake, and to ſet our conſciences on work in this duty; If any of us ſhall bee tormented with an headach

or a toothach, or with the ſtone, or ſtrangury, or a hot fever, or ſome other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting paine, that will not ſuffer us to take any reſt; we may make the like uſe of the burning fever, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ach which we feel, that this <hi>Cook</hi> did of the ſcorching fire, which he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon. We may think, if this little ſmart in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and theſe ſhort tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeem ſo unſufferable, as that I would not endure them for a yeare together, though I might gaine a Kingdome by it; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable are the eternall torments of hell fire, and what a fool am I, if I plunge my ſoule into them for ever for gaining of a paltry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2455:32"/>
and a fading and a filthy pleaſure? And if after drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a cup of pleaſant wine in our thirſt, or after eating a good dinner in our hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, or if after a ſweete ſleep when we have been weary, we finde our ſelves comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refreſhed; then there is occaſion to think, O Lord how much more joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing will it bee to my ſoule, when I ſhall <hi>reſt from all my labours in Abrahams boſom,</hi> and with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhall <hi>eate bread in the Kingdome of God,</hi> and ſhall bee fed with <hi>the pleaſures of Gods houſe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore?</hi> And againe, if at any time wee be overjoyed (&amp; who ſometimes is not?) when ſome great prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2455:33"/>
befalleth us, ſuch as are a high place in the Court, a great office in the City: or ſome matter of much gaine in our trading; then it will be ſeaſonable to think, if ſuch a ſcant advancement do ſo much overjoy mee, what a joy will it bee, and how ſhall I rejoyce, when I ſhall be taken to bee Gods adopted ſon, and to be heire of his Kingdome, and a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizen with the Saints in glory? And thus we may doe on all the like occaſions: and if thus we do doe, ſtill converting earthly occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences into matter of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditations, we ſhall be profited toward ſalvation by every thing of moment that we ſee or heare abroad,

and by thoſe things which we find &amp; feel in our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>But this practice is never more ſeaſonable, nor never more profitable, then when we come to the <hi>Lords Table.</hi> In this Sacrament wee have for the outward matter of it, bread and wine, in ſubſtance the ſame with that which is upon our own boards, but in uſe of a far different na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.

And when the bread and wine is delivered into the Communicants hand; that telleth him, that God the Father doth now reach unto him from heaven, the fleſh and blood of his deare Son, that they may nouriſh his ſoule to eternall life, as the bread and wine doth nouriſh his body for this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life.

                     <p>The proofes for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof are three, 1. The teſtimony of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> 2. The condition of worldly happineſſe in it ſelf conſidered. and 3. Its want of thoſe excellencies, that are in the true bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The firſt proofe is the Teſtimony of <hi>Solomon</hi> ſet down in the book of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes.</hi> In it his Teſtimony
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2455:37"/>
is delivered 2. wayes. 1. In a generall doctrine. 2. In particular inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. His doctrine is this; Of all worldly bleſſings, and the happineſſe that men can gaine by them, he ſaith in the entrance of his book, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of vanities, ſaith the Preacher; vanity of vanities: and all is vanity. Eccleſ.</hi> 1.2. He meaneth that all the things of this life, without godlineſſe and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are meere empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and things of nothing. Thus hee beginneth his ſpeech concerning the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering greatneſſe of this world, and then of the true bleſſedneſſe, that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth Gods ſervice, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the concluſion of

that book; <hi>Let us heare the concluſion of the whole matter; feare God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: for this is the whole duty of man. For God ſhall bring every work into judgement, &amp;c. Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13, 14. Where 1. when hee ſaith, <hi>Let us heare the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all,</hi> hee meaneth that that which now hee was to ſay, namely to <hi>feare</hi> God, and <hi>keep his commandements,</hi> was the ſubſtance of all that needed to be ſaid, the ſumm of all that either the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher needed to teach, or the people needed to learne. This alone is ſufficient to make a man happy. And 2. when he ſaith, <hi>for this is the whole duty of man,</hi> he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the reaſon, why he had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2455:38"/>
ſaid of godlineſſe that it was the <hi>ſumme of all,</hi> namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the whole duty of man, that is, all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bleſſedneſſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory.

It was onely the <hi>feare of God</hi> and his ſervice that could yeeld that which he ſought for. This is the firſt proofe of the point: and it is a full
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2455:39"/>
and a cleare one.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond is, the <hi>Condition</hi> of worldly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and it is this, that for all the goodly ſhews that they make, yet if they bee without godlineſſe, they leave a man ſtill in a curſed and a damnable ſtate. For a man may have good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and himſelfe may be a bad man. So it was with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> his ſon; and with <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>EZekias</hi> his ſon; and with <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſias</hi> his ſon. And ſo a man may have riches, and honours, and pleaſures; and yet be in a worſe caſe, then the begger that lyeth at his gate. So it was with <hi>Dives</hi> in the Goſpell: he was <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2455:40"/>
with purple, and fared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately every day,</hi> and was honourable among his neighbours; and yet <hi>Dives</hi> was in a miſerable caſe even in the midſt of all this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. A few dayes did but paſſe over his head; and hee was caried into hell, and tormented in that flame, and could not obtaine ſo ſmall a comfort, as a drop of water to coole his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And whereto now did all his former pomp ſerve him, but onely to make him more ſenſible of his torments? <hi>Miſerum eſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe foelicem;</hi> It is an increaſe of a mans miſery, that hee hath formerly been happy. And now I dare ſay there is never a man living, but will think that <hi>Lazarus</hi> with all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2455:40"/>
his beggery and ſores was in a far more happy condition, then <hi>Dives,</hi> who lived in ſuch plenty and honour. And this example alone, (to ſay nothing of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and ſuch like; this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I ſay alone) is proofe enough, that all worldly bleſſings may leave a man in a miſerable and curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for any help that they can afford him. And doth that deſerve the name of happineſſe, that leaveth the poſſeſſors of it in ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and curſed ſtate?</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Thirdly, the ſame truth is further proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this world is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2455:41"/>
of thoſe prerogatives which are the proper glory of the true bleſſedneſſe, namely theſe 3. fulneſſe, ſincerity, and eternity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt prerogative is <hi>fulneſſe</hi> without any lack or defect. For true bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is accompanied with full joy, even as much, as either the heart can deſire, or the ſoule receive. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of this bleſſedneſſe, ſaith unto God; <hi>In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſſe of joy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> A veſſell is ſaid to bee full, when it hath as much, as it can hold; and ſo that joy is full, when it is as much as there is any roome to receive it. And ſuch is the joy ſaith <hi>David,</hi> that is in Gods Kingdome.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2455:41"/>
But that ſpeech of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is yet more ſignificant and full, when it is ſaid to the good ſervant, <hi>Enter into the joy of thy Lord. Mat.</hi> 25.23. For when we ſpeak of a cup of water, wee doe not ſay that the man entereth into it, but that it entereth and is taken down into the man: becauſe that water though it may fill the man, yet it is no greater, then the capacitie of the mans ſtomach, into which it is received. But if we ſpeak of a river, or a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tub, or ſuch like large continent, we cannot ſay, that the river, or the tub of water entreth into the man, but rather that the man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or entereth into it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the quantity or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2455:42"/>
of that water is greater then the man is capable of, or can receive. And ſo in this caſe when our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth his faithfull ſervant, into his heavenly Kingdom,<note place="margin">Tam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum eſt gaudium coeleſtis patriae de Deo, ut non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludi in homine: &amp; ideo homo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat in gaudium illud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibile, &amp; non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trat gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud in hominem velut compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſum ab homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jet. in Mat. 25.23.</note> he ſaith not, <hi>Let the joy of thy Lord enter into thee,</hi> but <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> becauſe, as a learned Writer obſerveth, thoſe joys of Gods Kingdome are ſo full, that they run over, and cannot be contained within us, our ſcant veſſels are not large enough to receive them. Such is the fulneſſe of joy that is found in true bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But now the bleſſedneſſe of this world (take it when it is at the beſt and at the fulleſt) though it have its
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2455:42"/>
comforts and its joyes; yet a fulneſſe of joy it cannot be ſaid to have, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſomething is wanting that that happy man ſtill doth deſire: and that in two reſpects; 1. becauſe there is no ſuch fulneſſe or perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in any one bleſſing, but that he who hath it, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more. 2. becauſe if any man had as much of one bleſſing, as he could deſire, yet there would be a want of ſome other bleſſing, that would diſturb his joy in that which he poſſeſſed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no fulneſſe in one worldly comfort, but ſtill there is a want of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that the man would have more then that which he hath. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a King
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2455:43"/>
and had great poſſeſſions and lands; but yet hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a <hi>garden of herbs,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard might make; &amp; for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he could not eate: and therefore he killed <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> that hee might enjoy his inheritance. And ſo now a dayes, a man may bee a great rich man, ſay he bee as rich as this world hath any; and yet he hath not ſo much land, but he ſeeketh to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe more, nor ſo much money but hee thinketh what way hee may increaſe his ſtore. And ſtill wee ſee it happen as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he who <hi>loveth ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver; nor he that loueth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, with increaſe. Eccl.</hi> 5.10.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2455:43"/>
And ſo it is in other things: <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the eare with hearing. Eccleſ.</hi> 1.8. He that hath an able body; ſay as ſtrong as <hi>Samſon;</hi> yet wanteth ſound<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſome ſtrength, or ſome agility, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth by phyſick, and food, and exerciſe to increaſe or amend. And hee that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with great learning and much wiſdome, ſay hee were as wiſe as <hi>Solomon;</hi> yet findeth each day ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and learneth by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall experience, that there are mo things, which hee knoweth not, then thoſe are which he knoweth. And ſo wee may ſay of all other things of this life; they are never ſo great, but more
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2455:44"/>
may be added, and more wil be deſired. And therefore there is no fulneſſe in them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Say, that a man were ſo happy, as to enjoy ſome one bleſſing in ſuch perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as that hee neither needeth nor deſireth more: yet he is ſhort in ſome other bleſſing, the want of which will abate or rather damp his joy in the other. For example, <hi>Naaman</hi> was rich and <hi>valiant</hi> and <hi>honourable:</hi> but yet <hi>Naaman</hi> was a <hi>Leper,</hi> and ſought with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and great coſt, to bee eaſed of this diſeaſe. And ſo it is with us; a man may have ſome bleſſings that may comfort him: but yet hee wanteth many others that will afflict him not a little.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2455:44"/>
It may bee a man may bee rich, but unlearned; or rich and learned, but unhealthy; or rich and learned and healthy (though all this is but ſeldome ſeen in one man;) but yet he is unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his wife, or in his children, or in his friends, or in his credit, &amp;c. But the man was never yet known, that enjoyed all things, that he could wiſh. And if there bee a want of ſome good things; then there is not a fulneſſe of all joy. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the worldly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is much ſhort of the true happineſſe, in which there is fulneſſe without want, and perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any defect.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. True happineſſe hath
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:2455:45"/>
this prerogative, that it hath ſincere joyes, without <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of any other ſorow. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Revelation deſcribeth true bleſſedneſſe to be ſuch, as that men who enjoy it, <hi>ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt any more, neither ſhall the ſun light on them, nor any heate. Apoc.</hi> 7.16. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.4. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes: and there ſhall bee no more death, neither ſorow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more paine.</hi> In which words, 1. when he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall hunger no more, &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth there ſhall bee nothing within them that may breed them any paine. 2. When he ſaith, <hi>Neither ſhall the ſun light upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:2455:45"/>
hee implyeth that nothing from without them, ſhall annoy them. 3. When hee ſaith, <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes;</hi> he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us the reaſon, why there is ſuch perfection of good, and ſuch freedome from evill; and that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in heaven wee enjoy God himſelfe by immediate viſion, and in God there is no defect: but while wee are in this life, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and upheld by the uſe of the creatures; and all they are defective and imperfect. And hence the concluſion is, that in heaven there is no more death, nor no more ſorow, nor no more paine.</p>
                     <p>But contrariwiſe the bleſſings of this life have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2455:46"/>
ever ſome tang of ſorow mixed with them, which will damp all the joy. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> was quaffing it in his cups, and frollicking it with his friends, when loe, there <hi>came forth the fingers of a mans hand,</hi> and wrote his judgement upon the wall: at the ſight whereof the Kings <hi>countenance was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and his thoughts troubled him,</hi> ſo that the <hi>joynts of his loines were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another. Dan.</hi> 5.5, 6. And ſo <hi>Haman</hi> was one of the worlds dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, in great favour and highly advanced by the King, and invited by the Queen to one banquet after another: ſo that <hi>Haman went out joyfull and with a glad
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2455:46"/>
heart:</hi> and a man would have thought that hee had been the Minion, on which the world had choſen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow her choiſeſt favours. But <hi>Haman</hi> was no ſooner gone out overjoyed with his great preferments, but hee met with <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew, who would not doe him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence: and this unreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiveneſſe in a poore alien did ſo pierce his heart, that he was forced to ſay; <hi>All this</hi> [greatneſſe] <hi>availeth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as I ſee Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai the Iew fitting at the Kings gate. Eſter</hi> 5.9, 13. And ſo it is with all other the happy men of this world. Either men do moleſt them, and fill them full of feare, or of anger, or of envy, or of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2455:47"/>
ſome other unquiet paſſion; or elſe God from heaven doth thunder upon them, and ſetteth their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt them, which (as the poet ſaid,) ſurdo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere caedit, <hi>giveth them many a ſmarting laſh, when the world heareth not the ſtroke.</hi> Thus one worm or other there is, which gnaweth upon their heart, while they rejoyce in their pomp; and they ſtill finde <hi>Solomons</hi> proverb to be true, <hi>Even in laughter the heart is ſorowfull; and the end of that mirth is heavineſſe. Prov.</hi> 14.13. In this reſpect then the worldly happineſſe is not comparable to the happineſſe of heaven, all whoſe joyes are without mixture of any griefe.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:2455:47"/>3. True happineſſe hath <hi>eternity</hi> added to its joyes. As they are <hi>full</hi> without want of any good, and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> without mixture of any evill; ſo they are <hi>eternall</hi> in the continuance of them both. In the deſcription of the laſt judgement it is ſaid of<note n="*" place="margin">Come ye bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Gods bleſſed ones, that <hi>they go into life everlaſting. Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>ult.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith of theſe joyes, <hi>At thy right hand, O Lord, there are pleaſures for evermore. Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> that it is an <hi>everlaſting Kingdome.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. and <hi>an inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath appointed this life to be a paſſage to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2455:48"/>
other; but the life to come to be the permanent and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed ſtate, in which all men receive their reward. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Dives</hi> being in hell, deſired that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might come out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſome; to refreſh him; No, ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> that cannot be, for <hi>betwixt us and you is a great gulfe fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that they which would paſſe from hence to you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; neither can they paſſe to us, that would come from thence. Luke</hi> 16.26: Implying, that there is no removing nor no changing in the life to come; but thoſe that are once in hell, ſhall be in hell for ever, and thoſe that be in heaven, neither can nor will depart thence. The bleſſedneſſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2455:48"/>
then of heaven, which is the onely true bleſſedneſſe, is eternall and unchangeable.</p>
                     <p>But it is not ſo with the happineſſe of this world: they are changeable, nay changing every day: and that two waies, or in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: Either becauſe they are of a fading nature, and may leave us when wee have moſt need of them; or becauſe we are of a mortall conſtitution, ſubject to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and death, and then we muſt leave them, if they leave not us before.</p>

                        <hi>Iob</hi> was a happy man in all worldly reſpects, happy in his children, and happy in his authority, and happy in his poſſeſſions, ſo that there was <hi>none like him</hi> in all the land: but in one day thieves came and caried away his oxen and his aſſes, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his ſervants; and a fire from heaven came, and burnt up his ſheep, and the ſervants that kept them, and a winde from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe came, and caſt downe the houſe where his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were, and deſtroyed them all. Nor was this all,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2455:49"/>
with the loſſe of children, and goods, and poſſeſſions, hee loſt his authority and command alſo. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was before<note n="(b)" place="margin">Job. 29.21. &amp;c.</note> honored of the beſt, now<note n="(c)" place="margin">Job. 30.1, 9, 10.</note> the very boyes had him in <hi>deriſion,</hi> and the abjects of the world made him their <hi>ſong.</hi> And thus it is with us now alſo. Be a man never ſo rich, and ſo plentifull in all things; yet either thieves may rob him, or falſe ſervants may beguile him, or bad credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may faile him, or fire may conſume him, or ſome misfortune or other may befall him, and ſweep all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a moment. And if his goods be once gone, then farewell his honour, and his credit, and his power: hee

that ſate before on the bench like a Judge, may with <hi>Iob</hi> fit upon the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill without any man that will care for him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, ſay, that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preferments abide with us ſtill; Yet if they leave not us, we are ſure to leave them; nor can we ſay, how ſoone it may be. The rich man in the Goſpell had laid up much wealth, which hee ſuppoſed ſhould ſerve him for <hi>many yeares:</hi> and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they might ſo, ſaving that he himſelfe wanted dayes to enjoy them. Hee ſaid, <hi>Soule, thou haſt much goods laid up for many yeares; eate, drink, and be merie.</hi> But <hi>God ſaid,</hi> (and his word muſt ſtand) <hi>Thou foole, this night
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2455:50"/>
thy ſoule ſhall be required of thee: and then, whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, that thou haſt provided? Luke</hi> 12.19, 20. And ſo now, we that are in health this day, are not ſure that we can live till the next day. If now wee bleſſe our ſelves in our fortunes, and think our ſelves happy in our children, in our friends, in our preferments, in our poſſeſſions and houſes, and make an account that wee are now ſetled to our mind: yet how can we be ſure, that it may not bee ſaid to us from heaven, <hi>Thou foole, this night,</hi> or this day will they take away thy ſoule from thee. And then whoſe ſhall thoſe dwellings, and thoſe preferments, and thoſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2455:51"/>
friends and thoſe offices, and thoſe bags and cheſts; whoſe ſhall they be, when thou goeſt to thy grave and they cannot follow thee?</p>
                     <p>This point is of uſe divers wayes: it ſerveth for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the poore, for admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the Rich, and for inſtruction to us all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. It is for comfort to the poore. For if the things of this life have ſo little matter of happineſſe in them, why ſhould any man grieve to want that, which can do him no more good? And if there be ſuch perfection of happineſſe in enjoying God and a good conſcience, why ſhould any man be diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for want of other things, while hee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2455:51"/>
enjoyeth theſe? <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi> was ſo well contented with the favour of the King, that when <hi>Zibah</hi> his ſervant had couſened him of the one halfe of his lands, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Nay, let him take all, foraſmuch as my Lord the King, is come againe in peace to his own houſe.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.29, 30. meaning that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for lands &amp; livings, ſo he might enjoy the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King. And much rather may every poore Chriſtian ſay; It mattereth not though I bee robbed of my goods, and turned out of my poſſeſſions, and left deſtitute of all things, ſo that I may enjoy Chriſt, and his merits and live with God in glory. Let the world
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2455:52"/>
take all; ſeeing I have God to be my father, and Chriſt to be my Saviour, and the holy Spirit to be my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter. This comfort and contentment the pooreſt man that ſerveth God aright may gather from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. It is for admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the rich and great men of the world: it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, not to place hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in theſe outward things. S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction to <hi>Timothie</hi> is, <hi>Charge them that be rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertaine riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. In theſe words I note two things; 1. What
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2455:52"/>
rich men are charged with, and that is, that they <hi>truſt</hi> not in their riches, as if they were ſafe, becauſe they were great, or happy becauſe they were wealthy. and 2. Why they ſhould obſerve this charge, and that is implyed in the condition aſcribed to their riches, <hi>uncertain</hi> riches. For it were a folly to truſt in that which may faile us, when we have moſt need of it. And as rich men may not truſt in their riches; ſo <hi>honourable</hi> men muſt not truſt in their honors, and <hi>learned</hi> men muſt not truſt in their learning, and <hi>popular</hi> men muſt not truſt in their credit with the multitude: nor may any man truſt in man or humane things. But
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2455:53"/>
as our Saviour, when one ſhewed him the goodly buildings of the Temple, <hi>Seeſt thou theſe great buildings?</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>there ſhall not be left one ſtone upon another, that ſhal not be thrown down.</hi> So when we look upon ou faire hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wee ſhould ſay to our ſelves; There is never <hi>a wall</hi> in this houſe, nor tile on this roofe, but it will waſt and come to nothing: nor can I have any certain dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, till I have an houſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God eternall in the heavens. And when wee look upon our Lands and Lordſhips, our thoughts ſhould be theſe or ſuch like. There is never <hi>a foot</hi> of this ground, nor never a <hi>parcell</hi> of theſe poſſeſſions, but will be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2455:53"/>
taken out of my hands, and be poſſeſſed by I know not whom. And ſo when wee look on our cheſts of gold, and preſſes of cloths, &amp; cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards of plate; when on our goodly children, and rich friends and kinred: ſtill wee ſhould tell our ſelves; <hi>All theſe things will faile and forſake me yer long.</hi> Not a peny of all my coine; nor a rag of all my garments, nor any man or woman of all my kinred and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, can folow mee to my grave, or eaſe mee of my paine, or help mee at my greateſt neede.<note place="margin">Luke 12.33. Luk. 16 9.</note> And oh then my ſoule, why do not I lay up treaſures in heaven, and provide bags that wax not olde, and make mee ſuch
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2455:54"/>
friends of my goods, as, when I faile, may receive me into everlaſting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Theſe thoughts rich men may learn from this doctrine. And if they learn it well, they will not bee proud of their worldly wealth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. This point is for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of us all. We hence may learn, ſeeing worldly bleſſings are nothing to the bleſſedneſſe of heaven; that therefore we ſhould be very fooles, if wee would part with heaven for any thing upon earth. Wee all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the <hi>prophaneneſſe</hi> of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſold his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for a meſſe of pottage. And we deteſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who ſold his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2455:54"/>
Saviour for a few pieces of ſilver. And there is as great cauſe to condemne the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt dealer, that for a ſmall gaine, maketh away his right to heaven. And ſo I may ſay of the ambitious man, who ſelleth Chriſt for honours; and of the vain-glorious man who ſelleth him for praiſes of men; and of the intemperate man, who ſelleth him for his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheare; and of the laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, who ſelleth him for carnall pleaſure; and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, who for any thing in this world, ſelleth away God and a good conſcience. Let not us be ſo unwiſe, as to make ſuch fooliſh bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines; Rather learn wee of <hi>Naboth</hi> to hold faſt our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2455:55"/>
                        <hi>Ahab</hi> offered him as good a vineyard, as that was, if he would part with it for the Kings uſe; but <hi>Naboth</hi> anſwered, <hi>God forbid, that I ſhould give thee the inheritance of my fathers.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.3. The devill though hee be an impudent lyer, yet cannot for ſhame ſay, that hee can give us as good a bleſſing on earth as the bleſſedneſſe of heaven is. And therefore when he offereth us honours and preferments and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and poſſeſſions to bee gained by wicked or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of heaven and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe; How much rather ſhould wee anſwere him in <hi>Naboths</hi> words, <hi>God forbid</hi> that I ſhould ſell away
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2455:55"/>
the inheritance of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father; or part with ſo glorious a poſſeſſion for ſo vile a price. Let the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill offer ſuch bargaines as theſe, to the fooles of the world, whoſe mindes the God of this world hath blinded, that they cannot ſee either the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or the vanity of earthly things.</p>

                     <p>This is plainly and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confirmed by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuch as theſe are:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not in the counſell of the ungodly, &amp;c.

Mat.</hi> 5.10. With many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like ſayings to the ſame purpoſe. In all which I note two things: 1. That they ſpeak of a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, not of any worldly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, ſo called: for they place this bleſſedneſſe in the right to the Kingdome of heaven; and they aſcribe this bleſſedneſſe to <hi>perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ſuffered for Chriſts ſake, which is quite contrary to the nature of worldly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. 2. I note that theſe Scriptures doe place the ground and roote of this bleſſedneſſe in holineſſe and a godly life. Lay theſe two together, and they prove the point, that true and celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſſedneſſe belongeth to Gods ſervice or a godly life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:2455:57"/>More then this needeth not for proofe of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but for more full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it, 3. Queſtions are to be cleared; 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this bleſſedneſſe doth conſiſt. 2. Why it is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the ſervice of God. And 3. how men are ſaid to partake of this bleſſedneſſe in this life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The firſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, wherein this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth conſiſt: and the anſwer thereto is, that it conſiſteth in the immediate fruition of God, of and by himſelfe ſupplying all good things, and expelling or driving away all evill. In this anſwere I ſay three things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:2455:58"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That it is in the <hi>fruition of God.</hi> For all the good, that wee have or can have, is from him. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being. Acts</hi> 17.28. and <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and commeth down from the father of lights. Iames</hi> 1.17. And if every good gift, then bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe among the reſt, or rather more eſpecially then any of the reſt, is given us of God our heavenly father. And when from him we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this bleſſedneſſe, then are wee truly ſaid to enjoy him, becauſe he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth himſelfe unto us in one of his eſpeciall bleſſings. For as a man is ſaid to enjoy the Sun, when
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2455:58"/>
by its preſence and aſpect, it communicateth light and influence unto him; and as he is ſaid to enjoy a friend, who hath his company and acquaintance, ſo as he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him; or, as the Apoſtle ſaith, that God <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us richly all things to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17; when wee have them, &amp; may uſe them for our good: ſo, and in the like ſenſe we are ſaid to have the fruition of God, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, when he is ſo neare unto us, and in ſuch manner preſent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> us, as that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth unto us his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and bleſſings. And that thus the bleſſed man doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God, I take it to be plain, when it is ſaid in the Goſpel;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2455:59"/>
                        <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Mat.</hi> 5.8. For to ſee God includeth two things, to enjoy him, and to live in his preſence in his glory. That it ſignifieth to enjoy him, appeareth by the cuſtome of Scripture phraſe; In which, to <hi>ſee good</hi> is to enjoy it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12. and, <hi>to ſee good dayes,</hi> is to enjoy good dayes. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. and to <hi>ſee corruption</hi> is to partake of it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. and to <hi>ſee death,</hi> is to ſuffer death. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.51. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. and <hi>not to ſee good or evill,</hi> when it commeth; is as much as not to partake of it. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.6, 8.</p>
                     <p>And if in the Scripture phraſe, to ſee good, and to ſee evill, and to ſee death,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2455:59"/>
and to ſee corruption, bee to partake of them, and when the ſpeech is of that, which is good, to enjoy them; then I doe but ſpeak according to the phraſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if I ſay that to <hi>ſee God,</hi> in that place of the Goſpell, is to enjoy him: and ſo to ſee and enjoy him, is the Bleſſed mans portion.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I ſay in the firſt place, that Bleſſedneſſe doth conſiſt in the fruition of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>B.</hi> Secondly, I ſay, that this fruition, belonging to the bleſſed man, is the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fruition</hi> of God. For underſtanding hereof wee muſt note, that there is a two-fold enjoying of God; the one mediate, and the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2455:60"/>
other immediate. <hi>Mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> we are ſaid to enjoy God, when hee communicateth himſelfe unto us by ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary meanes, and by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he feedeth us by meate and drink, lightneth us by the ſun, inſtructeth us by his word, ſtrengtheneth us in grace by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When thus God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his bleſſings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, (as he ſtill doth in this life) then we are ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him mediately. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are ſaid to enjoy God immediately, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth himſelfe unto us without any other thing between. And thus wee are ſaid to enjoy God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2455:60"/>
two wayes; 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of preſence: and 2. In reſpect of influence. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>preſence,</hi> our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God is ſaid to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,</hi> when wee live with him in the place of his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and where his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour dwelleth: and that is, in heaven above, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith to God; <hi>Heare thou in heaven, thy dwelling place.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.30, 39, 43, 49. For while wee live here in this world, wee are ſaid to be <hi>abſent from the Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are out of the place of his dwelling. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. But when once we have left this world, and are gone to heaven, then we are ſaid to be <hi>preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. And then, ſaith
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2455:61"/>
the Apoſtle, <hi>Wee ſhall ever be with the Lord.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. And from hence it is that the wicked are ſaid to bee <hi>puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. and that of the godly it is ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life; for in thy preſence is fulneſſe of joy, at thy right hand there are pleaſures for evermore. Pſal.</hi> 16.11. and that <hi>where Chriſt is, there ſhall his diſciples be alſo. Ioh.</hi> 14.2, 3. and that <hi>they follow the Lamb whither ſoever he goeth. Apoc.</hi> 14.4.</p>
                     <p>Which ſpeeches doe prove that the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do enjoy God in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner then they here
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2455:61"/>
did, while they lived in the fleſh: namely, that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they enjoy him in his palace, in the place of his proper dwelling, without ſeparation or diſtance of place, which is found in all them, which enjoy God moſt nearely in this world. And this alſo, as before I ſaid is implyed in that ſaying of the Goſpell, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> For this to be meant or intimated by the <hi>ſeeing of God</hi> in this place, may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be gathered from other places of Scripture, in which it is ſaid, that <hi>now we ſee in a glaſſe, but then wee ſhall ſee face to face.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. and in which we are ſaid in this life, <hi>to walk by faith, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2455:62"/>
not by ſight.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. He meaneth that here wee are led by an <hi>inevident</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure</hi> kinde of knowledge; for ſo the Learned define faith to be, agreeably to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen. Heb.</hi> 11.1. but in heaven we ſhall walk or live <hi>by ſight,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there the immediate and open view of Gods face in Glory. In heaven then, where all they, that are the bleſſed of God, ſhall bee, there men enjoy God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in reſpect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Secondly, they enjoy him immediately in reſpect of <hi>influence.</hi> For there God communicateth himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by immediate ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue received from himſelfe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2455:62"/>
without the uſe of any meanes. This is ſignified by that in the Revelation, where S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Great City, the holy Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he ſaith of it; <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein; for the Lord God almighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it. And the City had no need of the ſun, neither of the moon to ſhine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. Apoc.</hi> 21.22, 23. Where 1. when he ſaith, <hi>I ſaw no Temple in it;</hi> he giveth us to underſtand, that in heaven there will bee no uſe of the outward meanes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if there be no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then there are no prieſts nor no preaching, nor no
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2455:63"/>
Sacraments, nor no ſolemn aſſemblies; for where there is need of theſe, there, there is uſe of a Temple alſo: In this world, where we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord, theſe things are neceſſary, and by them God communicates himſelfe to his ſervants. But in the life to come <hi>prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall faile, and the uſe of tongues ſhall ceaſe,</hi> and the meanes of <hi>knowledge</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <hi>ſhall vaniſh away;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. 2. When hee ſaith, that this City had no need <hi>of the ſun, nor of the moon to ſhine in it;</hi> he imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the outward meanes of our naturall life ſhould ceaſe. Here in this world the ſun giveth us light by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2455:63"/>
day, and the moon by night; and here meate and drink do nouriſh us, and clothes keep us warm: but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there will be no neede, nor no uſe of ſuch things: &amp; <hi>The children of this world mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and are given in mariage: but they which ſhall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy to obtain the world to come, and the reſurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in mariage, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die they any more. Luke</hi> 20.34. By all which wee learn that all natural meanes, now uſed for preſervation of mans life, ſhall then be at an end. 3. When S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be no Temple in it; for the Lord God and the Lamb are the Temple of it:</hi> and againe, <hi>There is no neede
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2455:64"/>
of the ſun, &amp;c. for the glory of God doth ſhine in it, and the Lamb is the light of it:</hi> he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us the reaſon, why all outward helps and meanes are of no uſe there. It is not becauſe there is no ſervice of God uſed there; for they ſhall ſing praiſes to him without ceaſing: nor it is not, becauſe men there ſhall bee deprived of life and ſtrength, and vigour; for there they never dye, nor never hunger, nor never faint: but the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God and his Sonne Chriſt ſhall without any meanes, ſupply all good things unto them, by vertue derived immediately from themſelves; and that in a more plentifull and more
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2455:64"/>
excellent ſort, then all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary meanes or cauſes could do. This alſo is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignified by that of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith that <hi>Chriſt ſhall deliver up his kingdome to God.</hi>—and ſhall himſelfe <hi>be ſubject unto God, that God may bee all in all.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. that is, Chriſt ſhall ceaſe to govern his Church in that manner of adminiſtration that now he uſeth; and God ſhall doe all by himſelfe. And by this it appeareth to be true, which I ſaid in the ſecond place; that in glory and in the ſtate of heavenly bleſſedneſſe, we enjoy God immediately, both in reſpect of preſence and in reſpect of influence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>C.</hi> Thirdly, I ſay yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2455:65"/>
that this immediate fruition of God ſupplyeth unto the Bleſſed all good things, and expelleth or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth away all evill. This the Scripture ſaith alſo. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of the Saints in heaven, that <hi>God ſhall wipe away all teares from their eyes; and there ſhall bee no more death, neither ſorow, nor crying; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall there bee any more paine. Apoc.</hi> 21.4. By this he ſignifieth the removing of all evill, or whatſoever might hurt or afflict. He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on: and ver. 6. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the great King) <hi>will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that is a thirſt, of the fountaine of the water of life freely. He that overcommeth ſhall inherite all things: and I will be his God, and he ſhall bee
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2455:65"/>
my ſon;</hi> meaning that hee would give him all things neceſſary for bleſſedneſſe and an happy life.</p>
                     <p>And from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that in the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heaven, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want of good, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of any evill.</p>
                     <p>And now, theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars laid together, the ſumme of them gathered into one, is, that the true bleſſedneſſe which is in heaven commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Saints, is an <hi>immediate fruition of God,</hi> of and by himſelfe ſupplying all good things, and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or driving away all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill things. And this may ſerve for clearing of the firſt queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The ſecond is,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2455:66"/>
why this bleſſedneſſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed or appropriated to the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion my anſwer is, bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is aſcribed to holineſſe, or Gods ſervice; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe holineſſe is a neceſſary condition for qualifying of thoſe perſons, which ſhall enjoy it: and partly, becauſe it is a kinde of cauſe, that doth effect or procure it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>neceſſary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> for ſo the Apoſtle teacheth us, when he ſaith; <hi>Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> .i. (as before I explained the word) no man ſhall enjoy God in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. And ſo S. <hi>Iohn: Bleſſed are they that doe his commandements,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2455:66"/>
that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City. For without are ſorcerers and whoremongers, and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and idolaters, and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loveth and maketh a lie. Apoc.</hi> 22.14. In which words; 1. When he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that doe his commandements, that they may have right, &amp;c.</hi> he intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that obedience to Gods will is a condition, upon ſuppoſall whereof men may attain this bleſſedneſſe. And 2. when he ſaith, for <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are ſorcerers, &amp;c.</hi> Hee telleth us in plain termes, that no wicked man ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enter into heaven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Holineſſe and Gods ſervice is a kinde of cauſe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2455:67"/>
that procureth this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for them that ſerve God. <hi>A kinde of cauſe</hi> I call it by way of qualification or diminution; becauſe it is neither any proper <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe, which by vertue in it ſelfe may effect it; nor any <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe, which by its worthineſſe can deſerve it. And yet a cauſe it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which moveth God for his promiſe ſake, to confer heaven and happineſſe upon them that doe ſerve him, and keep his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This the Logicians call <hi>cauſa procatar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> or a morall cauſe, which worketh by way of object: and I did therefore call it a kinde of cauſe, becauſe I am ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2455:67"/>
by the Apoſtle, who ſpeaking of affliction born with patience and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods will, ſaith of it, that it <hi>worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. And if patience in affliction doe this, no man may deny the like to all other parts of obedience: and if they may be ſaid to <hi>work for us</hi> eternall glory, then no man may hinder me to ſay, that they are a kinde of cauſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this glory. I conclude then that Gods ſervice is both a neceſſary condition, and a kinde of a cauſe, to procure bleſſedneſſe: and therefore to it bleſſedneſſe is rightly aſcribed. And ſo the ſecond queſtion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:2455:68"/>3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, how may men bee ſaid to be bleſſed in this life, in which we are abſent from the Lord, and enjoy him not in ſuch immediate ſort, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, as <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> doth, <hi>[Hic in ſpe, in futuro in re,] Here wee are bleſſed in hope, but ſhall be bleſſed indeed, in the world to come.</hi> For, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>heire</hi> in his minority, that though he <hi>differ nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> [in his preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſubjection] <hi>yet hee is Lord of all;</hi> becauſe he hath the right to all for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſhall have the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all, when the full time is come. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. ſo, and in the like ſenſe, we who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2455:68"/>
are ſubject to many croſſes in this life, yet may bee ſaid to be bleſſed, becauſe now we have a right to that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate, and ſhall in due time have the poſſeſſion of it.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as alſo for the clearing of the whole point.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1. This ſerveth firſt to ſet an edge on our zeale, and to make us in love with heaven and eternall life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe here are ſuch things as men do deſire and ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For firſt, men deſire wealth and lands and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of needfull and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things. The labourer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth heavy burdens, and ſweateth under his labour
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2455:69"/>
that hee may earne wages; the ſhopkeeper forbeares meate and drink and ſleep, that hee may increaſe his gaine; the Merchant ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth life and living, that he may make his ſtock great: and every man taketh pains, and endureth hardneſſe, and undergoeth dangers, that he may become rich, or reap a plentifull reward, and they do it to obtain a corruptible treaſure. But the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have ſpoken of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; hath plenty of all good things, without lack, without meaſure, without end. The <hi>bags</hi> here <hi>wax not olde;</hi> the <hi>treaſure</hi> that is here, cannot bee eaten by the mothe, nor ſtollen by the thieve, nor waſted by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2455:69"/>
of time: nor can they either be taken from us, or we from them, by any caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty or miſchance. And why then ſhould wee think any paines too great, or any coſt too much, or any danger too hard, by which going on in Gods ſervice, wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch an unvaluable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? Or if wee ſhrink at the thought of too much, at leaſt let us do as much for heaven, as the labourer doth for his hire, or as the ſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper doth for his gaine, or as the Merchant doth for his eſtate. And if we will bee Chriſtians, that profeſſe Gods ſervice to be our trade, and heaven and happineſſe to bee our reward; let us think it a ſhame, that they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2455:70"/>
ſhould labour ſo conſtantly, and ſo chearefully for the commodities of this life, while wee grudge at every ſmall labour in praying, and hearing, and examining the conſcience, and mortifying of our carnall luſts; or while wee repine at every ſmall ſumme beſtowed for Gods ſervice and for ſetting forth of his praiſe; or while we pull back and ſhrink at every petty loſſe in our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, in our credit, in our pleaſures and preferments; ſeeing by theſe meanes wee aſpire to an incorruptible Crown, to an inheritance in heaven, and to a kingdome, that cannot be ſhaken.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All men deſire and will endure much for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2455:70"/>
from miſery and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. Wee willingly lay our our money, and beſtow our labour, that by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding meate and clothes and maintenance, we may avoid hunger and thirſt and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And wee part with lands and poſſeſſions and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that we may redeem our liberty, rather then lye in yrons, or be tyed to a Galley. And if there be any feare of our death by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or dangers; then <hi>skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for ſaving of his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now this bleſſedneſſe of heaven, it hath freedome from all evils, and from all feare of danger. There (as hath been ſaid) is no more
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2455:71"/>
curſe, nor no more crying, nor no more death or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſorow, neither hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor thirſt, nor any thing to diſquiet our peace. And for ſuch a bleſſed and ſecure ſtate, if we will not doe, what we would do for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of priſon, and to redeem our ſelves out of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and to recover our ſelves from the ſtone or ſtrangury, from the goute or palſey, or from ſickneſſe and death; ſurely wee both overvalue theſe tranſitories, and undervalue heaven and happineſſe, more then is tolerable in him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelfe to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian, and God Almighty to bee his <hi>exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:2455:71"/>3. Laſtly, there is no man but if he aſk his own heart, it will tell him, that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is to be deſired above all. In all ages there have been great diſputes, and much difference about the matter of happineſſe; ſome thinking it to conſiſt in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and others in pleaſures, and others in honours and preferments: but there was never any man, but did think and profeſſe that true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is the <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> the greateſt good, that any man could have, or would deſire. This is a principle ſo graffed in nature, that no diſputes of philoſophers, nor no differences of opinions could ever roote it out. But all Chriſtians now know,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2455:72"/>
that the true bleſſedneſſe is in the fruition of God in glory. And why then ſhould any Chriſtian make more account of the vanities of the world, then of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of heaven? or why ſhould wee ſtick at any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the fruit whereof will be eternall life? or why ſhould we not deſire hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with the loſſe of all things? with this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration our Saviour ſtirred up his diſciples to the hardeſt ſervice: <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake; for theirs is the Kingdome of heaven.

                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:2455:76"/>1. By Teſtimonies of Scriptures; ſuch as theſe are. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of his Goſpell; <hi>Theſe things are written, that ye might beleeve, that Ieſus is the Chriſt, the ſon of God; and that beleeving, ye might have life through his name. Ioh.</hi> 20.31. In theſe words S. <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth us, that he wrote his Goſpell for this end, that men by it might be brought to beleeve in Chriſt, and to be ſaved. And from hence it followeth, that either the holy Ghoſt propounded to himſelfe a wrong end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering this Goſpell (which no Chriſtian dareth imagin;) or elſe that this Goſpell hath vertue in it to bring men to ſalvation. Again, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Goſpel of Chriſt,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2455:77"/>
that it is the <hi>power of God to ſalvation, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth. Rom.</hi> 1.16. And S. <hi>Iames</hi> exhorteth, <hi>Receive with meekneſſe the ingraffed word which is able to ſave your ſoules. Iames</hi> 1.21. And our Saviour to the like purpoſe, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>for in them yee think ye have eternall life: and they are they, that teſtifie of me.</hi> In all which ſayings there is a <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> vertue aſcribed unto the Scriptures: and in this laſt, is intimated unto us, that it was the known opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Gods people in thoſe dayes. <hi>Yee think, in them ye have eternall life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. It is as if he had ſaid, not I onely, but your ſelves alſo do agree, that eternall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2455:77"/>
life is to bee found in the Scriptures: and therefore there is reaſon yee ſhould ſearch them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſame truth may be gathered from the Titles, which are given to Gods word. It is called the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of the <hi>Kingdome. Mat.</hi> 4.23. and the Goſpell of <hi>ſalvation. Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that the grace of God, and the Kingdome of heaven, and ſalvation is there to be found, and from thence to be derived. Again, it is called the word of <hi>Gods grace. Acts</hi> 14.3. and, the word of <hi>reconciliation.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and the word of <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Acts</hi> 13.26. and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2455:78"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. the <hi>immortall ſeede,</hi> by which we are new born. All which names and titles given to the word, what doe they elſe import, but that therein there is meanes contained to work grace and reconciliation and eternall life?</p>
                     <p>This is proofe enough for the point: yet it will bee worth the labour to conſider how Gods word may bee ſaid to contain this vertue, and wherein it ſheweth it ſelfe. And thereto the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer is, that this vertue of Gods word ſheweth it ſelfe by three things: 1. By tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ready way to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe. 2. By perſwading men to walk in that way. And 3. by enabling them
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2455:78"/>
with grace both to beleeve what it teacheth, and to do what it perſwadeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It teacheth the right way; or, it teacheth what to beleeve, how to live, and by what meanes we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of this word, that <hi>it is able to make one wiſe to ſalvation through faith in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> and <hi>that it is profitable for doctrin, for reproofe, for correction, and for inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to all good works.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. In theſe words we have three things to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this purpoſe. Firſt, there is the main ſcope and end, for which the Scripture ſerveth: namely, to make
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2455:79"/>
one wiſe to ſalvation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there are the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular uſes of this word, by which it maketh men wiſe to ſalvation: and they bee theſe; firſt it is profitable for <hi>doctrine,</hi> to teach what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we neede to beleeve. Secondly, for <hi>reproofe;</hi> or, to confute and detect all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary errors, that gainſay the doctrine of truth. Thirdly, for <hi>correction,</hi> or to reprove all ſins that are againſt Gods will, manifeſted in his word. Fourthly, for <hi>inſtruction</hi> in righteouſneſſe, or to inform us in every duty belonging to our callings. In ſumme, it teacheth the <hi>truth,</hi> which we ought to beleeve, and the <hi>duties</hi> that we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, with conviction and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2455:79"/>
confutation of whatſoever is contrary to either of theſe two: ſo that wee may nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther be miſled with any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror againſt the faith, nor miſperſwaded to any ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods Law. Theſe be uſes for which the Scripture is profitable. Thirdly, there is the ſufficiency or ability which men gain by theſe uſes; and that is, that the <hi>Man of God,</hi> even he that is bound to know, and doe moſt, may want no directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may ſerve either for inſtructing of his faith, or ordering of his life. Now by all this we have a punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and plentifull deſcription of the doctrinall vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Gods word. If any deſire further conſent of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2455:80"/>
Scriptures, he may take that of <hi>David, Thy word is a lanterne to my feete, and a light unto my pathes. Pſal.</hi> 119 105. and that of <hi>Solomon, All the words of my mouth are in righteouſneſſe: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing froward or perverſe in them:</hi> and that of <hi>Iſay, To the Law and to the Teſtimony: if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them. Iſay</hi> 8.20. and that of our Saviour, <hi>Do not ye erre, becauſe ye know not the Scriptures? Mar.</hi> 12.24. By all which, as by other like places of Scripture, it is cleare, that the Scriptures ſhew the right way, and the ignorance of Scriptures is the cauſe that men erre and goe aſtray out of the way.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:2455:80"/>II. Secondly, the word of God containeth bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it, becauſe it afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth arguments of <hi>perſwaſion,</hi> and by them doth win our aſſent to walk in that way. And that it doth 3. wayes; 1. By loving invitations, ſuch as theſe are; <hi>I beſeech you by the mercifulnes of God, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 12.1. and <hi>God doth beſeech you by us,</hi> and <hi>We pray you in Chriſts ſtead, Bee yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. 2 It perſwadeth by graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>promiſes</hi> of much good to be obtained; ſuch as theſe are; <hi>Keep ſound wiſdome and diſcretion. So ſhall they be life unto thy ſoule, and grace unto thy neck. When thou lieſt down, thou ſhalt not be afraid: Yea, thou ſhalt lie down, and thy
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2455:81"/>
ſleep ſhall be ſweete. Bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of ſudden feare, neither of the deſolation of the wicked when it commeth. For the Lord ſhall be thy confidence, and ſhall keep thy foot from being taken. Prov.</hi> 3.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch is that of <hi>Moſes: Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the City and in the field. Bleſsed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 28.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that of our Saviour; <hi>There is no man, that hath left houſe, or brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my ſake and the Goſpels: but hee ſhall receive an hundred fold now in this time, houſes and brethren, &amp;c. and in the world to come eternall life. Mar.</hi> 10.29, 30. 3. It perſwadeth by <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of plagues and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2455:81"/>
againſt all diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſin, ſuch as theſe are; <hi>If thou ſhalt corrupt thy ſelfe, and ſhalt do evill in the ſight of the Lord thy God, &amp;c. I call heaven and earth to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse againſt you this day, that ye ſhall ſoon utterly periſh from off the land, whereunto yee goe to poſseſse it. Deut.</hi> 4.26. and that of the Apoſtle, <hi>God will take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpell of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. and that of our Saviour at the laſt judgement; <hi>Then ſhall he ſay to them on the left hand, depart from me, ye curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2455:82"/>
fire, prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and his Angells. Mat.</hi> 25.41.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like bee the arguments of perſwaſion which the Scriptures uſe to keep us in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and to bring us to eternall life. And he that hath the heart of a man in him, and is not moved with ſuch reaſons; hath in the ſhape of a man caſt off all humanity and reaſon. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties by the mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus, move us not, wee are more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull then many bruites be, which attend on their Maſters, by whom they are fed. If promiſes of rewards and happineſſe do not move us, we may be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2455:82"/>
ſenſible of our owne wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. And if puniſhments and plagues, eſpecially the <hi>worme that dyeth not, and the fire that never is quenched,</hi> if theſe move us not, how far ſhort doe wee come of the wiſdome that is in the dogg and the horſe, and the aſſe, all which are forced to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the rod, and the ſpurre and the whip, even when they are but threatned againſt them. And conſequently, if theſe many forcible perſwaſions contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Gods word, do not worke with us to the obedience of Gods will, the complaint will bee juſt againſt us, that was uſed againſt the Jews; <hi>What could have beene done more in my
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2455:83"/>
vineyard, that I have not done it it? Wherefore, when I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wilde grapes? Iſ.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Thirdly, there is a vertue of bleſſedneſſe in Gods word, becauſe where it is preached, it bringeth with it that grace of God, which being entertained by us, doth enable us both to beleeve what it teacheth, and to performe what it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth unto. The proofes of this point are gathered to my hands, by our learned <hi>Divines</hi> of great Britaine, who were a chiefe part of the <hi>Dort</hi>-Councell.

And <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.9, 11. <hi>When Chriſt ſent his ſeventie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to preach the Goſpell, he commanded them to ſay to their hearers; The Kingdome of God is come nigh unto you; doubtleſſe, becauſe ſupernatural grace was adminiſtred to thoſe men, to whom the Goſpell was
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2455:86"/>
preached.</hi> Againe, for proofe of the 2. point, that there is ſo much grace offered, as <hi>may convince them of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> who doe not beleeve and obey; the ſame learned men alledge that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſinne; but now they have no cloke for their ſin. From this place it is plaine,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that Chriſt in propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Goſpell, did alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter that internall grace, which was thus far ſufficient, that becauſe they did not accept but reject the Goſpel, they might be convinced of poſitive infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> They add that alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19 <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world and men loved darkneſſe rather
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2455:87"/>
then light. Men therefore are juſtly damned for rejecting the light of the Goſpell. Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall wee eſcape, if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great ſalvation? for neglecting ſalvation offered in the Goſpell,</hi> (as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the words) <hi>wee become guilty of juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore ſalvation is offered in the Goſpell.</hi> Theſe with ſome more, bee the proofes brought by theſe learned men. And they plainely prove, that God doth accompanie the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of his word with the aſſiſtance and grace of his Spirit; that men, who heare the word, if themſelves bee not in fault, do receive from God, both to beleeve and obey it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:2455:87"/>Now lay theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, firſt, that the word of God doth teach the right way to bleſſednes; then that it uſeth powerfull perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to incite us on in this way; and laſtly, that it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it that grace of God which may carie us along to our journeys end: and then the concluſion will eaſily reſult from them, that therefore Gods word hath much vertue in it, and that which is ſufficient to make us eternally happy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This condemneth them of follie, who leave Gods word, and ſeeke other directions to eternall life. Such were the Jews of old, and ſuch have beene ſome ignorant papiſts in our time.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2455:88"/>
What our vulgar papiſts are uſed to ſay for proofe of the true religion; they that have lived among them, do ſufficiently know: and what the Jews ſaid in former times, <hi>Ieremie</hi> hath told us at large, chap. 44. And whoſo ſhall attentively conſider his words will eaſily ſee, how like our papiſts are to thoſe Jews. The words of the Prophet are, <hi>Then all the men, which knew that their wives had burnt incenſe unto other Gods, and all the women that ſtood by—anſwered Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, ſaying; As for the word, which thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee. But we will certainly doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thing goeth forth out of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2455:88"/>
our own mouth, to burn incenſe to the Queene of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we &amp; our fathers, our Kings &amp; our Princes, in the cities of Iudah and in the ſtreets of Ieruſalem: for then had we plentie of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls and were well, and ſaw no evill. But ſince wee left off to burne incenſe to the Queene of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, wee have wanted all things, &amp; have beene, conſumed by the ſword and by the famine. Ier.</hi> 44.15. &amp;c. In this paſſage of the Prophet there are 2. things ſet downe, the reſolution of this people, and their reaſon for it. Their reſolution was, that they would not hearken to the word which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:2455:89"/>
had ſpoken in the name of the Lord: but they would doe what they did doe, that is, they would burne incenſe to the Queene of heaven, &amp;c. And the like is the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſome ſeely people. Say what you will, or what you can out of Scriptures, they care not for it: but they will doe, what they are woont to doe; that is, they will pray in a tongue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they underſtand never a word; they will worſhip Saints and Images, though they know not why; and they will reſt their faith on the Popes dictats, though they can ſay nothing why he may not miſleade them. But this they doe, and this they will do. This is their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2455:89"/>
Secondly, we may conſider their <hi>reaſon,</hi> why they were ſo wilfull, and that is two-fold; 1. becauſe they and their fathers had beene accuſtomed to doe ſo heretofore. <hi>As wee have done; wee and our fathers, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo our poore ignorant people; This is the religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was borne and bred; and therein will I dye. Thus my father and grandfather beleeved before I was born; and I will folow them, who have gone before mee. The ſecond reaſon, why they would continue in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution is, becauſe when they lived in that faith, they had <hi>plentie of victuals</hi> and ſtore of all things; but after they left their ſacrificing to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2455:90"/>
Idols, they had ſcarſitie, and miſerie and want. <hi>Then ſay they, we had plentie of victuals,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo are our ſeelie ones wont to diſpute. Oh, ſay they, when the old reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was on foote, then we had ſo many eggs for a peny, and ſo much provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at a ſmall price, and poore men were able to live by their labours: but ſince Calvin and Luther began to reforme, we have ſcarſitie and dearth, and it is a hard world, to live in. Thus our people are wont to reaſon, for their old ſuperſtitions and errours: and they ſpeak ſo right in the very phraſe and words of the idolatrous Jews, that I might have thought they had borowed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:2455:90"/>

had given him this anſwere, The incenſe, which yee burnt in the cities of Iudah, and in the ſtreets of Ieruſalem, ye and your fathers—did not the Lord remember them, and came it not into his minde: ſo that the Lord could no longer beare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evil of your doings, and becauſe of the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ye have committed? Therefore is your land a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an aſtoniſhment, and a curſe, without an inhabitant, as at this day. Becauſe ye have burnt incenſe, and becauſe ye have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore this evill is happened unto you. Ier.</hi> 44.20, &amp;c. In which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere we may conſider, and it is worth the noting, that their <hi>burning of incenſe,</hi> to the Queene of heaven, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:2455:92"/>
their pouring out of drink-offerings unto her, which they thought was the true worſhip, and ſaid it was the onely cauſe of their <hi>plentie of victuals</hi> and of all good things; was in very deede an abomination to God, which hee could no longer beare, and the true cauſe of the deſolation &amp; curſe that was come upon them. And ſo, when our ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay, that the reformed religion is the cauſe of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and want, &amp; that while they worſhipped their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Saints, there was plentie and ſtore: wee may anſwere them according to the tenor of the Prophets words; Nay rather, your ſuperſtitions, in burning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2455:93"/>
to the Queene of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as they did; and your wilfulneſſe in refuſing the truth, when it is brought unto you, as they alſo did; theſe and ſuch like abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are the cauſe, that ye, and we for your ſakes, doe ſuffer at Gods hands; as they did in the caſe before us. But as for ſuch as know and ſerve God better, and acknowledge Gods word to teach the right way: if any dorrell ſhall tell them of cheapneſſe of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls, and example of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and their owne idle cuſtomes, as rules to guide their faith by; let them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them in the wiſe mans words, <hi>Say not thou, what is the cauſe, that the former daies
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2455:93"/>
were better then theſe? for thou doeſt not enquire wiſely concerning this. Eccl.</hi> 7.10. Or elſe, let them return ſuch men an anſwere out of the Prophet, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony: if they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Secondly then, if Gods word have ſuch vertue in it, both to perſwade and enable us to Gods ſervice; we may hence take notice of our great negligence, who having had ſo long uſe of this word, have profited ſo little by it. For, if a childe have good and holeſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2455:94"/>
meate, &amp; yet do not thrive, nor grow by it; ye will ſay, and ye have great cauſe to ſay, that he is out of temper, and ſomewhat is amiſſe with him. And if a ſick man have good and ſoveraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines given him, and yet is not purged, nor eaſed by them; ye will ſay that either nature is much decayed in her ſtrength, or much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by bad humours. And ſo ſeeing Gods word hath in it ſuch vertue towards godlineſſe and a happy life; if we, after long uſe of it, are not bettered in our knowledge of God, and increaſed in our obedience to his Laws, and ſome way or other furthered toward heaven and happineſſe, it is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2455:94"/>
an evident ſigne that grace is decayed in us, and ſinne hath gotten the upper hand. And yet ſo it falleth out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times among Chriſtians. The Hebrews were <hi>dull of hearing,</hi> and <hi>when for the time they might have beene teachers, yet they had neede that one ſhould teach them againe, which were the firſt principles of the oracles of God. Heb.</hi> 5.11, 12. And is it not ſo with a great many of us? Are there not men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who after many years teaching, have gained no great meaſure of true lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? If by the Catechiſmes they have been taught, and by the Sermons that they have heard, and by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and other bookes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2455:95"/>
which they have read, they had learned but every week, nay every moneth, one only good leſſon, appertaining to godlineſſe, they might by this time have proved ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Caſuiſts in matters of conſcience. But this is not ſo great a defect as that which followeth. Our knowledge is much more better then our practice. God complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his vineyard (and that vineyard was the houſe of Iſrael) that after much care and paines beſtowed in the dreſſing, in ſteede of good grapes, which were rightly expected from it, it brought forth wilde grapes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. The meaning is, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expoundeth it <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>He looked for judgement, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2455:95"/>
oppreſsion, and for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, but behold a cry;</hi> even a cry for wrongs and oppreſſions, &amp; injuries done to their neighbours. And now a dayes, may not God complaine of us in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? There was never more dreſſing of Gods Vineyard, then now there is: more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to teach the way of bleſſedneſſe, more exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to laye hold upon eternall life, or more threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings to deterre men from ſinne. But may not God ſay now after all this, <hi>I looked for grapes,</hi> fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holineſſe and of a ſober life: but I finde <hi>wilde grapes,</hi> of lying, and of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening, &amp; of oppreſſing, and of ſlandering, and of ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2455:96"/>
and drunkenneſſe, and of new fantaſtick faſhions. And if theſe be the fruits of our hearing and reading and profeſſing; we may feare, leſt that threatning may be ours alſo; <hi>This will I doe to my vineyard, I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall bee eaten up; and breake downe the wall thereof, and it ſhall be troden downe. And I will lay it waſte: it ſhall not bee pruned, nor digged, but there ſhall come up briars and thornes. I will alſo command the clouds, that they raine no raine upon it. ver.</hi> 5. and 6. He meaneth that after ſo much labour loſt, hee would take away the meanes of grace, and leave them to themſelves; which is a fearefull judgement, not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2455:96"/>
to be thought on, without trembling. It will bee our wiſdome then to look every one into his owne garden, &amp; ſee what fruits he findeth there. If we finde there any grapes of gall, or vine-ſets of Sodom; or if our wine prove the poiſon of dragons or the venom of aſpes: it will be high time to take the pruning knife, and cutt off theſe wilde branches, that beare ſuch bad fruits, or rather to take the pick axe and the mattock and to grub up the plants, on whoſe rootes they grow: that wee may bee trees of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, bringing forth fruits anſwerable to the labour beſtowed upon us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. If there bee ſuch
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2455:97"/>
vertue in Gods word to make a man bleſſed, we ſhould learne to eſteeme it as our happineſſe, when wee doe enjoy it. So <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I rejoyce for thy word,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as one that findeth great ſpoiles. Pſal.</hi> 119.162. On which words a good writer giveth us this note, that <hi>David</hi> compareth the enjoying of Gods word to the getting of <hi>great ſpoiles,</hi> rather then to the having of any other riches, becauſe ſpoiles taken from enemies do not onely enable men with wealth, but honour them alſo with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of victorie. And ſo wee ſhould eſteeme of the word of Gods grace, as a treaſure that doth farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede both riches and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2455:97"/>
elſe that cannot bring us to heaven and happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>And from this eſteeme we may learne three duties;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To praiſe God, that hath given us ſuch a treaſure. So <hi>David</hi> did; In a Pſalme of his, which was framed for a forme of thankſgiving to God, and therefore he both beginneth it and endeth it with, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord:</hi> in this Pſal. he reckoneth this as a chiefe mercy for which he giveth God thanks, that he <hi>ſhewed his word unto Iacob; his ſtatutes, and his judgments unto Iſrael. Pſ.</hi> 147.19. And ſo we ſhould reckon it, as one of Gods rich mercies towards us, that wee have ſuch plentie of his word, that may bring us to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2455:98"/>
&amp; eternall life: and in remembrance hereof both begin our morning and ſhut up our evening, as <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and ended his Pſalme, with <hi>Praiſe wee the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may learn, to uſe all good meanes to get this treaſure into our owne poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, <hi>that the word of Chriſt may dwell in us richly in all wiſdome,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.16. Solomons counſell for attaining this wiſdome, is that wee <hi>ſeeke for it, as for ſilver; and ſearch for it, as for hid treaſure. Prov.</hi> 2.4. Hee intimateth in this ſpeech, that if any of us did know, that there were a mine of gold to be found by ſeeking, wee would be glad it were in our own ground,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2455:98"/>
wee would moreover digge the earth &amp; hew the rocks, and draine the mariſhes, that nothing might hinder our obtaining of that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And in ſuch maner would Solomon have us to labour for the knowledge of God, that lyeth hid in his word. Young people ſhould deſire to be catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, old people to be further inſtructed, and all both yong and olde ſhould willingly undergoe that paines what ever it bee, that may open the Mine, and bring us to the ſight and poſſeſſion of this treaſure.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If there bee any of us who have children, whoſe happineſſe wee doe deſire; we learne from hence to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2455:99"/>
lay the foundation thereof, in the knowledge of Gods word. Moſes commanded parents, that they ſhould <hi>teach their children</hi> upon every occaſion, and acquaint them with Gods word and his commandements; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them that then their dayes, and the dayes <hi>of their children, ſhould be multiplied in the land—as the dayes of heaven, Deut.</hi> 11.19, 21. And ſo if ye would leave a good portion indeede for your children, and provide that they may live long upon earth, and eternally in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: catechiſe them in the principles of Gods word, ſow the ſeedes of godlineſſe in their tender mindes, and teach them how to follow
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2455:99"/>
the directions of Gods Law; and this will give them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to know the right way, and will follow them with exhortations to goe on in the way, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave them, till it give them poſſeſſion of heaven and eternall glory.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>I begin with hearing, and hereof, there are two kinds mentioned in Scripture; an hearing of the word read, as it is delivered in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and an hearing of the word preached, as it is unfolded and applied by the ordinarie Miniſter, ſent of God, for that purpoſe. Of both theſe it is true, that they are meanes, by which the bleſſednes of Gods word may bee conveyed unto us, and therefore both are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bee conſidered in their place and order.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then I ſay, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word read out of the Scriptures, is a meanes
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2455:100"/>
to make a man bleſſed, or to communicate bleſſedneſſe unto him.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. This is proved firſt by Teſtimonies of Scriptures: I will inſiſt onely upon two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that of Moſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The words are; <hi>Moſes wrote this Law, and delivered it to the Prieſts, the ſonnes of Levi;—And commanded them ſaying, At the end of every ſeven yeares, in the ſolemnitie of the yeare of Releaſe, in the feaſt of Tabernacles; When all Iſrael is come to appeare before the Lord thy God, in the place which hee ſhall chooſe: Thou ſhalt reade this Law before all Iſrael in their hearing. Gather the people together, men and women and children, and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2455:101"/>
ſtranger that it within thy gates; that they may heare, and that they may learne, and feare the Lord your God, and obſerve to doe all the words of this Law: and that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which have not knowen any thing, may heare and learn to feare the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land, whither ye goe over Iordan to poſſeſſe it.</hi> In theſe words we may note for this purpoſe theſe things: 1. what Moſes did: &amp; that is (1.) he wrote this Law, to wit that which God had delivered unto him for the inſtruction of his people: &amp; (2.) he delivered it to the Prieſts, that it might be for the uſe of the Church. And this ſheweth that the law whereof Moſes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2455:101"/>
ſpeaketh, was the written word of God committed to the Church. 2. Wee may conſider what Moſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prieſts to doe: and that is, that they ſhould <hi>reade</hi> this Law to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this is illuſtrated and amplified by 3. things: (1.) by the <hi>ſolemnity</hi> of the time, when it ſhould bee read, to wit in the great feaſt of Tabernacles, when all Iſrael were to bee preſent. (2.) By the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the perſons, in whoſe hearing it ſhould bee read; and they are ſpecified to bee <hi>men, women,</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> as well ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers as natives. (3.) Why, or for what end the Law was to bee read to all theſe ſorts of men, gathered in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2455:102"/>
ſuch multitudes. And the ends are diverſe one ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat to an other, ech former ſerving as a meanes for that which commeth after, and all of them tending and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to an happie life: the firſt is that they might <hi>heare</hi> it, the next, that by hearing they might <hi>learn</hi> it; &amp; the laſt that by hearing and learning, they might bee brought <hi>to feare God, and obſerve and doe all the words of that Law.</hi> Now laie theſe together that Moſes wrote this Law, and the Prieſts read this Law, and the people, all of them, heard this Law written and read unto them, by Gods appointment; and all this, for this end and purpoſe, that the people might feare
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2455:102"/>
God and keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and they plainely prove that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word written and read, is an approved meanes to an holy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to an happy life alſo. For hee that ſo heareth the word, that <hi>he is a doer of the worke, is bleſſed in his deede. Iam.</hi> 1.25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond teſtimony is that of the Prophet <hi>Ier.</hi> 36.5, 6, 7. <hi>Ierem.</hi> commanded <hi>Baruch</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am ſhutt up; I cannot goe into the houſe of the Lord. Therefore goe thou, and reade in the Roll, which thou haſt written from my mouth, the words of the Lord in the eares of the people, in the Lords houſe, upon the faſting day: and alſo thou ſhalt reade
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2455:103"/>
them in the eares of all Iudah, that come out of their cities. It may be, they will preſent their ſupplication before the Lord; and will returne every one, from his evill way.</hi> In this paſſage when it is ſaid, that <hi>Ieremie</hi> being reſtrained that himſelfe could not preach, did therefore command <hi>Baruch</hi> (and that by Gods appointment as appeareth <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3.) to reade <hi>Ieremies</hi> words in a written Roll; this ſheweth both that the people did heare the word written, and that it was a duty of conſequence and moment. And ſecondly, when he ſaith, It may bee, they will preſent their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, &amp; returne:—this implieth, that though there
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2455:103"/>
might be ſome doubt of the ſucceſſe, becauſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the people; Yet this was a likely way, and God made choiſe of it for that purpoſe, that they might relent, and repent, and amend their evill waies, and obtaine pardon, as is more plainely ſignified <hi>v.</hi> 3. And this againe proveth, that the hearing of the word, is a meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime men from ſinne, and to procure their pardon; and conſequently to make them bleſſed. <hi>For bleſſed is he</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion is forgiven, and whoſe ſinne is covered.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2455:106"/>
the Prophets are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and noted out in the Hebrew Bible, by which every one may ſee, what portions of the Bible were read every Sabbath to the people.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hes, was begun in the time of the primitive Church; onely with this
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2455:107"/>
difference, that whereas we now a daies do conſtantly reade our leſſons, one out of the olde and an other out of the new; they on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdaies and Sundaies (for in thoſe olde times, they kept both of them as holy dayes;) appointed and read both the leſſons out of the new Teſtament. By all which it appeareth that the Church of God in all ages have ſtill beene accuſtomed to reade the Text of the Scriptures to the people: the reaſon cannot bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be any other, then this, that the people by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Scriptures read might learne to ſerve God aright, and by his ſervice might obtaine eternall life.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2455:107"/>
And this proveth, that in all ages, the hearing of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures read hath been eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as an ordinary way to bleſſednes &amp; immortal life.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Thirdly, this point may further bee proved, and made more cleare by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the benefits and helps that a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may reape by hearing the word read. And they bee theſe and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It ſerveth to acquaint the people of God with the hiſtory of the Chuch, and Gods dealing with it. For example, they may heare in the olde Teſtament how God created the world, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Adam and Eve for their diſobedience, drowned the whole world for their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2455:108"/>
overflowing ſins, excepting <hi>Noah</hi> and his houſehould, whom he had found upright in that wicked generation: how hee deſtroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimſtone from heaven, delivered the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael out of the hand of the Egyptians, led them through a vaſte wildernes into a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full land, dryed up the river Jordan and the red Sea, to make a paſſage for his choſen ones; with many mo ſuch occurrences, which ech one may learne by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Text read, and by them may underſtand the goodneſſe of God, the ingratitude of moſt men, and the dutie of all; with many others points of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2455:108"/>
conducing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a bleſſed life. Againe, in the new Teſtament, if men heare the firſt chapters of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> read they will learne, that CHRIST our LORD was borne of a Virgin, perſecuted by <hi>Herod,</hi> honored by the wiſe men, and miraculouſly preſerved againſt thoſe that ſought his life. If they proceede further to the following chapters, there they will heare, what miracles our Lord wrought, what doctrines of religion he taught, what tentations he endured, and how hee lived from the Cradle to the Croſſe. And if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their hearing till the end of the Goſpell bee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, they may acquaint
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2455:109"/>
themſelves with the maner of his Paſſion, and his Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and his Reſurrection, and his Aſcenſion into heaven: all maine points of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and ſuch as every one ought to beleeve for the ſaving of his ſoule. And yet further, by hearing the hiſtory of the Acts, and the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, they may ſee, how the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtles preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, planted the Churches, healed the ſick, converted the Nations, and ſuffered great wrongs for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſake. The knowledge of all which, will both guide us in the way to heaven, and ſpurre us forward, to go on towards eternall life. For as <hi>David,</hi> after hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2455:109"/>
Gods dealings with the ancient Fathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth in the end of all, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe and will obſerve theſe things; they ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the loving kindneſſe of the Lord. Pſ.</hi> 107.43: So may I ſay of theſe and the like paſſages in Gods word, that whoſo is <hi>wiſe,</hi> and when hee hath heard them, will conſider them; they ſhall underſtand the wiſedome, and power, and goodneſſe and providence of God in the ordering of his Church, together with his juſtice &amp; ſeveritie againſt all them, that would not be reclaimed and amended; and hereby receive inſtruction for their owne ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, the hearing
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:2455:110"/>
of the Scriptures read, may ſerve to teach us many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duties of piety and an holy life. Every one of us may learne ſomewhat here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that may direct us how to ſerve God, how to honor our Superiours, how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne our inferiours, and how to behave our ſelves towards all men. For though the full &amp; diſtinct unfolding of theſe points bee left to the learned preacher, who is therefore brought up in Scholaſticall ſtudies, that he may be able to inſtruct the people in the ſenſe of Scriptures and in the duties of their calling, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly then they could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly learne by their owne induſtrie; Yet even of them
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2455:110"/>
ſelves, by hearing the word read, with attention, they may underſtand a good part of their dutie both towards GOD and men. For who is there even among the meaneſt Chriſtians, but if he heare the 20. chapter of <hi>Exodus</hi> read, will preſently reſolve with himſelfe, that hee is bound to reverence his parents, not to kill or ſtrike his neighbour, not to wrong him in his wife, in his goods, or in his good name? Or, who that ſhall heare the 13. chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> read, but will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conceive that it is his duty to obey the Magiſtrate? Or, if he heare the 5. and 6. chapters to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> but will know by the very
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2455:111"/>
words, that he is bound to do faithfull ſervice to his maſter, if he bee a ſervant; to be kinde to his wife, if he bee a maried man; and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to his parents, if he be a childe that is under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and carefull for the education of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if he bee a father of ſonnes or daughters? And the like may be ſaid of other the like caſes. All which ſhew, that the hearing of Scriptures read may availe a man much to the leading of an holy life. The further illuſtration whereof may be had out of ſome few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Firſt then, <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> an ancient Doctor of the Church,<note place="margin">Athanaſ. in vita S. Antonii pag. 445.</note> telleth of S. <hi>Antonie,</hi> that having firſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2455:111"/>
revolved in his minde, how the Apoſtles forſooke all and followed CHRIST, he came into the Church and in the Goſpell which was then read, he heard the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour to the yong rich man, <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, ſell all that thou haſt, and give to the poore, and come and follow me: and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven. Matt.</hi> 1921. And as ſoone, as hee had heard that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, hee went home and ſould his poſſeſſions, and gave them to the poore, and leaving all further care of the world, he betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly to a devout life. Secondly,<note place="margin">Auguſt. Confeſſ. lib. 8 cap. 12. pag. 37.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> telleth of himſelfe, that having heard of this ſtorie of ſaint
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2455:112"/>
                        <hi>Antonie,</hi> how he by hearing the Goſpell read was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God; hee in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this holy man, tooke up the booke that lay by, to reade, (for hearing of Gods word read, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, do not much differ in this reſpect;) and opening the booke at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, he read what firſt came to hand, and that was the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let us walke honeſtly, as in the day, not in rioting and drunkennes, not in chambering and wantonneſſe, not in ſtrife and envying, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13.13. Part of which words did ſo ſtrike his heart, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently forſook his looſe life, and betooke himſelfe to Gods ſervice. Thirdly, the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2455:112"/>
booke of God it ſelfe telleth us, that <hi>Ioſias</hi> having heard the words of the Law read, which threatened judgment againſt ſuch ſinnes, as were then too common among them; <hi>He humbled himſelfe, &amp; rent his clothes, and wept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and cauſed the booke to be read in the audience of the people:</hi> and both hee and they moved by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the booke read <hi>made a covenant with the Lord for converſion and amendment of life;</hi> as is recorded in the 2. booke of <hi>Kings,</hi> in the end of the 22. and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 23. chapter. By theſe examples wee learne, that if men come to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word read, with honeſt &amp; teacheable hearts,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2455:113"/>
as theſe good men d d, they may heare that by the ſole reading of the text, by which they may be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their ſins, and a carefull and devout ſervice of the Lord their God, as theſe holy men were before them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the hearing of the word read (if it bee heard with attention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, as it alwaies ſhould) will prepare and fitt peoples mindes for a profitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sermons. For when the Preacher in handling any point, ſhall alledge the Text; he that hath beene an attentive hearer of the word read, and hath imprinted the ſayings of Scripture in his minde; will remember and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2455:113"/>
acknowledge the words, as they are cited &amp; explained: and hereby hee will gaine theſe helps towards a godly life. 1. Hee will learne the ſenſe and meaning of hard places, if any be expounded, &amp; unfolded by the Preacher, which himſelfe underſtood not before. 2. he will be able, as his minde goeth along with the preachers words, in part to judge of the truth &amp; ſoundneſſe of his allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and afterward more fully and exactly to examine the things that were ſpoken, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> examined S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine <hi>whether thoſe things were ſo,</hi> as hee had ſaid. And laſtly, he will be enabled to remember every thing that is ſaid, the better;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2455:114"/>
a good part of the Sermon being ſetled in his memory by his former reading, and the reſt having neare cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with it, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on it. And he that is furniſhed with theſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, will eaſily profit by all that the preacher teacheth. But contrariewiſe, he that heareth Texts alledged in a Sermon, which he had never heard of before, can neither judge of the ſenſe, that is put upon them, nor underſtand the ſequels that are deduced from them, nor remember to any purpoſe what hath beene alledged out of them. I conclude then, that he who will profit by the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; muſt not neglect to heare the word read, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2455:114"/>
hee may imprint the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Scripture in his minde.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, by hearing the word read though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we underſtand not the meaning, yet we may at leaſt faſten the words in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories: &amp; if we carie away but the words and phraſes onely, we may thereby bee occaſioned to aſk direction from others, who underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them better. The <hi>Eunuch,</hi> when he read the Prophecie of <hi>Iſai,</hi> underſtood it not: but was hereby moved to enquire of the meaning of the Text. <hi>I pray thee,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of whom ſpeaketh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet this? of himſelfe or of ſome other man? Act.</hi> 8.34. And upon this occaſion,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2455:115"/>
                        <hi>Philip</hi> explained him the text, preached unto him the Goſpell of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him unto the faith, &amp; brought him by baptiſme into the boſome of the Church. And ſo it will bee with us. If when we heare the Text read, wee meete with ſome thing, which we underſtand not, yet even, that, if we do but cary away the words onely, will lie by us, till we meete with ſome more ſkilful then our ſelves, and of whom we may aſk, as the Eunuch did of <hi>Philip; I pray you, Sir, of whom</hi> is this ſpoken, or whereof is it meant, or how is it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with this or that Text which ſeem to ſay the contrary. And by this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2455:115"/>
if we uſe it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall every day gaine ſomewhat for our furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in grace. Wee ſhall either increaſe our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or amend our lifes or prevent ſome objections; or one thing or other wee ſhall gaine by it, that may do us good towards ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This firſt of all confuteth the practice of the Roman Church; who, when they reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, do it in ſuch a ſort, as fruſtrateth the end that God aimed at in the reading of them; and depriveth the people of that profit, which they ſhould reape by their hearing. For they reade it in unknowen tongue: and a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:2455:116"/>
language not underſtood by the hearers, is not for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;<note place="margin">Gen. 11.7, 8.</note> no, not of Babel it ſelfe. For I pray, how can it poſſibly be, that men ſhould learn by that writing, whoſe words they underſtand not? when <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded the Prieſts to reade the Law to the people,<note place="margin">Deut. 31.9, &amp;c.</note> as in the place of <hi>Deuter.</hi> before mentioned he did; ſuppoſe he had ſpoken in this manner unto them, (which is the reſultance of the Romiſh practice and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;) Yee ſhall reade all this Law in a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in Latin or Arabick, or ſome ſuch other tongue unknowen to the Jews; that they may heare it, and by it learne to feare God, and keepe his commandements:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2455:116"/>
how ridiculous and fooliſh would the ſpeech have been? Surely, S. <hi>Paul</hi> did think, that if an unbeleever ſhould come into a Chriſtian Church, and heare the Doctors ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in a tongue unknowen to the people, hee would think them no better then madd men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. Nor would any of us think him to be well in his witts, that ſhould reade unto a plaine Engliſhman, a Latin, Greek or Hebrew book, and in a ſerious ſort bid him to hearken and attend what that booke did ſpeake for his inſtruction and comfort. Yea, and they of the Church of Rome themſelves, when they reade to the people ſuch things, as they care for,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2455:117"/>
and would have men to know and obſerve, then they ſpeake to them in their mother tongue. Their <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivall</hi> and their <hi>Legend,</hi> they have beene accuſtomed to reade in the Church, in the knowen language of our countrey: Yea and at this time, though they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in the Latin tongue, as all their other Service is; yet when they give order to bring back the <hi>Chriſome,</hi> to the Church, and to keepe the child from bodily harm, they breake off their ſacred language and ſpeake to the people in their own mother tongue. <hi>Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers of this childe</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Manna. Sacerd. de Baptiſ. pag. 38.</note> (ſay they) <hi>wee charge you, that

ye charge the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to keepe it from fire and water; and other perills to the age of ſeven yeares, &amp;c. and that the mother bring againe the Chriſome at her purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now I would gladly heare from any learned Papiſt, why Latin ſhould not as well teach them to bring againe the Chriſome, as it can teach them to ſerve God in the duties of pietie, or to help their neighbours by the duties of mutuall love and charitie. Or, if they think it behoovefull for the people to have theſe rules of theirs propounded to them in the Engliſh and knowen tongue; why they ſhould not think it better and more availeable for
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:2455:118"/>
them, to deliver the rules of Gods word unto them in the like intelligible ſort, then in a foreine language. Surely, if a peeviſh humour to maintaine all abuſes of their Church were layed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the point would neede no long diſputing.</p>

By which things wee may ſee, what great care God and his Church had, that this dutie might be performed. And the like care they have of us at this day. For God hath ſent his word home unto us into our owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and to many of us even hard at our doores: ſo that wee neede not to make long journeys, as the people of the Jews did, who came out of all the parts of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2455:122"/>
Land to Jeruſalem to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And our Church hath aſſigned us the times of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the Bells give us warning when the time is come. And nothing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that can bee deſired in this kinde, if we be not wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting to our ſelves. And if after all this, wee ſhall neglect to heare God, when he ſpeaketh unto us for our inſtruction; what can we expect, but that he ſhould refuſe to heare us, when we ſpeake to him for help and aſſiſtance? Surely, he threatned to deale ſo with his people of old, <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded: I will alſo laugh at your calamitie, and mock when your feare
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2455:122"/>
cometh.</hi>—And, <hi>Then ſhall they call upon mee, but I will not anſwere; they ſhall ſeeke mee earely, but they ſhall not finde mee. Prov.</hi> 1.24, 26, 28. He meaneth, that becauſe they refuſed to heare him, when he taught them their duty out of his word; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would refuſe to heare them, when they made their prayers, for his help in their neede. And ſo, if we turn the deafe eare to God, when he ſpeaketh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in his word; it will be juſt with God to turne a deafe eare to us, when wee ſpeake to him in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Nay the Apoſtle goeth further, and aggravateth our ſinne above the ſinne of the Jews, by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2455:123"/>
of the time and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt and every tranſgreſsion and diſobedience received a juſt recompenſe of reward: how ſhall wee eſcape if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great ſalvation, which at fiſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him. Hebr.</hi> 2.2, 3. Where we have 2. things worth our noting; (1.) that the contempt of the Goſpel ſpoken by Chriſt and his Apoſtles is a greater ſinne, then the contempt of the Law delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. And (2.) that every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods word (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a contempt of obeying it; or which is more, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:2455:123"/>
of hearing of it) is a neglecting of our owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; becauſe the hearing of the word, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſalvation are by Gods ordinance lincked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. By the hearing of this word read, <hi>Ioſias</hi> and <hi>Antonie</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin</hi> were converted to God, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered toward ſalvation: &amp; what knoweth any of us, but if we come to Church, when we are invited thither, we may heare that chapter, or that part of the Goſpell read, which may turne us from ſome ſinne, or direct us to ſome neceſſary duty, and in concluſion help to ſave our ſoules?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome perhaps will ſay, Nay, but I can reade the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:2455:124"/>
Bible at home; and what neede I then to come to Church, to heare it read there?</p>
                     <p>This Objection involveth in it two queſtions, both which are worthy of our conſideration: 1. Whether reading of Gods word may be a ſufficient excuſe to free us from hearing it read. 2. Whether reading or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it read in privat may excuſe us from hearing it read in the publick aſſembly. Of theſe ſeverally.</p>
                     <p>And firſt for the former queſtion, that I may ſpeake more clearely and diſtinctly, I will part mine anſwere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three aſſertions or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Prop.</hi> There is good
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:2455:124"/>
uſe of both the one and the other. For hearing the word read, I have delivered my reaſons already: and the very ſame reaſons may ſerve to prove the uſe of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it alſo. For firſt it hath the teſtimony of Scriptures. The King is commanded to <hi>reade the booke of the Law,</hi> that thereby he may learn to do his duty. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. And when one aſked of our Lord, what he ſhould do to be ſaved, our Lord anſwered him by aſking an other queſtion, <hi>What is written in the Law? how readeſt thou? Luk.</hi> 10.25, 26. implying that by reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he might have learned an anſwere to his queſtion, and thereby have beene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2455:125"/>
how to be ſaved. And <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Have ye not read</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>what David did? &amp;c.</hi> And that implyeth, that by reading that paſſage of Scripture they might have been better informed, then to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the guiltleſſe. Thus, Reading of Scriptures by our ſelves is confirmed by Teſtimonies of Scripture, as well as the hearing of it read by the Miniſter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, it may be proved by examples of holy men, who have uſed this practiſe to their great profit, for example, <hi>Daniel</hi> by reading the Prophecie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> underſtood Gods will for delivering Iſrael out of their captivity. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2455:125"/>
The Eunuch by reading of <hi>Iſay</hi> the Prophet, was brought in the end to the knowledge of the Meſſias and Saviour of the world. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32. And S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> by reading <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. was converted from a vitious to a godly life: And ſo, if we reade Gods word with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care, wee may underſtand Gods will for our Redemption from Satan and ſinne, and we may learn that which may direct us to Chriſt the Saviour of the world, and may meete with ſome motives that may worke in us remorſe and repentance. Theſe uſes of reading Gods word may be learned by the examples produced.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:2455:126"/>3. Reading of Scriptures hath the like benefits and helps of grace, as were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ariſe from hearing of them read. For (1.) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as well as hearing may acquaint us with the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church, and the providence that God hath uſed in the governing and ordering of it. (2.) It may inſtruct us in the duties of our callings and places, for therefore the King was commanded to reade the Law, that hee might learne to feare the Lord his God, and keepe all the words of the Law, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19, 20. (3.) It will acquaint us with the words and phraſes and ſentences of Gods word: and theſe being layed up in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2455:126"/>
our memories, will prepare us for a profitable hearing of Sermons. And (4) it will occaſion us, and enable us, when wee doubt of any thing, to deſire direction from the learned, and by their directions to learne, what we could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by our ſelves. Theſe helps of reading I onely name and do but point at them; becauſe the former proofes uſed in the point of hearing are as applicable to this of reading. For theſe two, reading the word by our ſelves, and hearing it read by others, do alike repreſent to our minds the meaning of the holy Ghoſt in Scriptures: the difference in this reſpect only is, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2455:127"/>
the one doth it by the eye, and the other by the eare, which in reſpect of the maine end, the inſtruction and ſalvation of our ſoules, is all one. I conclude then that there is a like good uſe, both of reading the word, &amp; of hearing it read: which is my firſt aſſertion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Prop.</hi> When we read the Scriptures by our ſelves, we have this benefit by it, that if wee meete with a matter of difficulty of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall moment, we may <hi>pauſe</hi> upon it, and reade it over againe, and conſider of it in ſilence. And by this meanes, we may in the end under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what at the firſt we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not, &amp; may alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in our memories, that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2455:127"/>
which after once hearing or reading, would have ſlipped away from us. And herein reading by our ſelves is better then hearing things read by others. For when an other readeth unto us, our mindes and memories are tied to go along with his tongue: nor can wee command any time of pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and conſidering, when the occaſion doth require it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Prop.</hi> When we heare the Scriptures read by Gods Miniſter, who hath beene brought up in the rules of Grammar and Rhetorik; we ſhall gaine this benefit by hearing him, that the ſentences being diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, by their reſts &amp; pauſes,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2455:128"/>
and the words being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with the right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents and tone, and every clauſe ſo modulated by the voice, as is agreable to the matter expreſſed by them; the ſpeech ſo uttered will delight the ſenſes, and cary along the affections, and perſwade the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſway the whole man, much more then the ſame ſentences could do, if they were onely looked upon with the eye, or read without the right accent &amp; modulation of the voice. <hi>Aeſchines,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Quintil. lib. 11. cap. 3. pag. 666. Plin. l 2. epiſt. 3. Valer. Maxim. l. 8. c. 10.</note> when hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an Oration of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi> and perceived that the people were much affected with it; Yea, ſaid he but, <hi>[quid ſi ipſam beſtiam
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2455:128"/>
audiiſſetis,] What if yee heard Demoſthenes himſelfe?</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that if hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his owne Oration, it would have affected them much more. And ſo, if any ſhall reade the Scriptures either in ſilence without any voice, or with that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the voice, as is not agreable to art and reaſon, (and ſo ignorant people, many times do reade them;) the word of God would loſe a great part of that life and vigour which otherwiſe is contained in it, and by right modulation of the voice would appeare to the hearer. For example, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith <hi>what? have yee not houſes to eate and to drink in?</hi> if a man (as thoſe that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2455:129"/>
be illiterate ſome times do) ſhould read the word [what] without a note of interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, hee ſhould much weaken the power of that ſentence. And ſo when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the righteous ſhall be upon Him, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the wicked ſhall bee upon Him:</hi> if any ſhould reade the words without putting the accent upon the word <hi>Him,</hi> he would loſe the grace that belongeth to the Prophets words. And in this reſpect hearing of the word read by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who knoweth the rules of pronunciation and deliverie, is better, then the reading of it by our ſelves, who either ſpeake
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2455:129"/>
not to the eare, or keep not the right accent, or put not that vigour and life in the words, which is agreable to the matter. The ſumme of all is, reading the word, and hearing it read, ech of them hath a peculia vertue of his owne, which the other hath not, yet both of them, for the ſubſtance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are alike profitable and uſefull for a Chriſtian. And therefore it is beſt, when both are joyned together, and uſed in their fitt places and times. And this may ſuffice for anſweare to the firſt queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The ſecond is, Whether reading in privat, may excuſe us from hearing it read in publick. To this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2455:130"/>
my anſwere is, No. And my reaſons be theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It may be a queſtion, whether they who alledge their privat reading to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them from publik hearing, do alwayes ſpend the houres of hearing in the Church, in their reading at home. Surely, the beſt of us are negligent inough in holy duties, and doe quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forget the times of devo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, and our purpoſes of well doing; unleſſe we have ſome monitor, that may put us in mind. Now for the ſervices of the Church, the ſett houre of the day and the ſound of the bell accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it, doe ſummon us to work. But what ſummons ech one hath at home, to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2455:130"/>
call him into his cloſet, and warne him to his taſk of reading, I know not, I leave every mans conſcience to be his owne Judge. Onely I will ſay thus much, that if men can diſpenſe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for publik hearing, when the time is appointed by the authority of the Church; it is no breach of charity, to think that they will diſpenſe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their privat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the time thereof being limited, onely by their own diſcretion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Say, that men and women be ſo exact and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, that they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the times of publik ſervice unto privat devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reade at home as
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2455:131"/>
much the more for their able ſence from the Church, as they could heare, if they were preſent there: Yet I dare ſay, they will not, nor cannot make ſuch choiſe of profitable chapters and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full leſſons, in their privat devotions, as the Church hath done for them in her publik Service. For here we have chapters and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells and Epiſtles fitted to the ſeaſon and the preſent occaſion. For example, when we celebrat the Feaſt of Chriſts Birth, thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are read unto us which relate the maner of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and the occurrences that then happened. And theſe two, the time and the Scriptures being fitted ech
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2455:131"/>
to other, do helpe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one an other. The Scriptures teach us how to celebrate the time to Gods glory and our owne good: and the time ſtirreth us up, to attend &amp; apply and make uſe of the Scriptures read. And the like may be ſaid of our Lords Conception, and of the preſenting of him in the Temple, and of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Reſurrection, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into heaven. And ſo it is alſo on the feſtivail dayes of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts &amp; other Saints. On their memoriall dayes thoſe Scriptures are read which tell us, what gifts God beſtowed upon them, and what ſervices they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him, and what
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2455:132"/>
good the Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by their meanes. And hence we may learne to honour God in his Saints, and to take example from their vertues for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to celebrate their feſtivities with heavenly meditations agreable to the time. And by ſuch helps as theſe are, wee may gaine knowledge in the articles of our faith, and direction in the duties of a good life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let it bee ſuppoſed (which yet I can not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve to bee true;) that a man or woman conſtantly ſpendeth in his privat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the whole time that is appointed for publik hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and that he and ſhe can
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2455:132"/>
make as good choiſe or Scriptures for their reading, as the Church hath done for their hearing: Yet, (all this notwithſtanding) their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat exerciſe will come ſhort of the publik, becauſe in the Church men may joyne both reading and hearing together. When they heare the Miniſters voice, they may look upon the Text in their booke; and ſo at once, they ſhall have the uſe both of eare and of eye: the one of which will ſtirre up the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the other will confirme the memorie; and at every pauſe may reflect back upon that ſentence, that importeth them moſt. And conſequently at one
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:2455:133"/>
time, and in the ſame exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, they ſhall in good part reape the benefits both of reading and of hearing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, ſuppoſe a man reapeth as much good by his privat reading, as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuch an exercice well ordered, can produce: Yet he cannot promiſe to his privat devotions the like bleſſing, that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the publik ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es of his Church. For of the Tabernacle hee hath ſaid, <hi>There will I meete, with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercie ſeate. Exod.</hi> 25.22. And of the Temple he hath ſaid, <hi>I have choſen this place to my ſelfe for an houſe of ſacrifice.</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.12. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 15,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:2455:133"/>
16. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall bee open, and mine eares attent to the prayer, that is made in this place. For now have I choſen and ſanctified this houſe, that my name may be there forever; and mine eyes and my heart ſhall be there perpetually.</hi> And ſo, of the Aſſemblies of Chriſtian people CHRIT hath promiſed, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. Matt.</hi> 18.20. By all which we may learne, that when we pray &amp; heare in publik, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a bleſſing, not onely to the exerciſes themſelves, but to the place alſo, where they are performed; even becauſe it is <hi>Gods houſe.</hi> But if wee performe the ſame
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:2455:134"/>
duties at home, though he hath promiſed a bleſſing to the ſervices, if they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in due ſort, yet hee hath promiſed no bleſſing to the place, becauſe it is any mans dwelling, or his <hi>privat cloſet.</hi> And now according to this rule and obſervation, a man may expect a further bleſſing upon his reading and hearing in the Church, then he can expect upon the like performances in his owne houſe.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the two queſtions, layed together, the ſumme is this: Reading of Gods word, and hearing of it read, are both of them good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, which God hath coupled together, and man
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2455:134"/>
muſt not put them a ſunder. Againe, the performance of theſe duties at home and in privat, is good in its ſeaſon, and may be a help that the <hi>word of Chriſt may dwell rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in us:</hi> but it muſt not in any caſe juſtle out the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſervice of the Temple, where God more eſpecially doth dwell. And therefore, as our Lord ſaid of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> compared with the duties of <hi>tithing aniſe and mint and cumine; theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Matt.</hi> 23.23. ſo may I ſay of publik and privat both reading and hearing; <hi>Theſe wee</hi> ſhould do, and not leave the other undone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:2455:135"/>My concluſion ſhall bee an Exhortation, conſiſting of two parts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That as occaſion and opportunitie will ſerve, wee be carefull to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in our privat houſes. When I ſay, as occaſion and opportunitie will ſerve, I meane, that I do not deſire, much leſſe require, that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould ſteale from their maſters the houres that be due to their ſervice or that maſters themſelves ſhould neglect the buſineſſes of their calling, in which God hath ſet them: but I meane, that both maſter and ſervant, and all other Chriſtians ſhould redeeme the time, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, that is, ſhould
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2455:135"/>
take the occaſion, and make their beſt advantage of it, while the time ſerveth. And he or ſhe who beſides the time allotted for ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes on Sundayes and holy dayes ſhall take thoſe ſhreds of time on the other dayes, which each mans buſineſſe will permit him without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wronging of others, or neglecting of his own eſtate; I doubt not but within a few yeares, he may be well read in the booke of God. It is reported of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of Arragon,<note place="margin">Serar. in Joſh. l. 2. pag. 289. &amp;c.</note> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his great affaires of government, and the daily buſineſſes of a Kingdome; yet he gained ſo much time for this uſe, as that he <hi>read over the Bible fourteen times,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2455:136"/>
with Gloſſes &amp; Commentaries</hi> upon the Text. And by this wee may gather, that no mans place, who is his owne maſter, is ſo full of buſineſſe, but if he will huſband his time well, &amp; not drown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in worldly cares, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh away his time in eating and drinking and ſporting, he may gaine ſufficient time for reading, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting of the works of his place and calling. Yea, and ſervants and labouring men, who have the feweſt houres to ſpare, yet if they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident for their ſoules, may now and then finde ſome leiſurable times for this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe without either wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of others, whoſe work they do, or defrauding of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2455:136"/>
themſelves of needfull times of refreſhing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. My exhortation alſo is, that wee do not ſuffer our ſelves to bee kept at home without urgent cauſe, when God by the ordinance of his Church doth call us into his houſe. There are not a few in the world, who partly through idleneſſe, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through fanſifulneſſe and contempt of government, deſpiſe the good orders of our Church, and neglect the publik ſervice to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God, and wronging of their owne ſoules. But they who are ſober minded, though they live in the midſt of ſuch a froward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, yet will conſider (and I beſeech them ſo to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2455:137"/>
do with heedfulnes &amp; care;) that God hath promiſed <hi>to meete with his people in the Tabernacle,</hi> and that <hi>his eyes will be open, &amp; his eares attent to the prayer that is made in the Temple,</hi> and that <hi>where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his name, he will bee in the midſt of them.</hi> And they may further be remembred, that <hi>David,</hi> when he heard that his child was dead, <hi>went into the houſe of the Lord and worſhipped.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20. And not onely the Phariſee, who delighted to ſhew his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in publik places, but the humble-minded Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican too, <hi>went up into the Temple to pray. Luk.</hi> 18.10. And <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> the bleſſed Apoſtles of our Saviour,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2455:137"/>
after they had beene filled with the holy Ghoſt, <hi>went up together into the Temple at the houre of prayer, being the ninth houre. Act.</hi> 3.1. Now there were none of theſe men, but might have found an houſe, or a cloſet, or a chamber to performe their devotions in: but they knew, nor did any man in thoſe dayes make queſtion of it, but that the <hi>houſe of God</hi> was the fitteſt place to ſerve God in, and that the houre appointed for publik prayer, was the beſt ſeaſon for them to preſent their prayers to God. They had not learned that ſubtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, which ſome phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtiks uſe now a dayes, that a <hi>privat prayer muſt not bee

made in a publik place.</hi> For then the Publican, whoſe prayer was well accepted with God, would not in ſo publik a place as the Temple in Jeruſalem, have made ſo pivat a prayer, as this, <hi>God be mercifull unto me a ſinner.</hi> Nor did they then beleeve, that there was any ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in obſerving the <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall houres</hi> of the Church: for then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> would not have choſen the <hi>ninth houre,</hi> which was one of the Churches houres in thoſe dayes, for their time of reſorting to the Temple.

                        </gap>] whereto it anſwereth, is ſometimes taken in a common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall acception, for any kinde of publiſhing or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, by what meanes ſoever it be done. Thus in the 12. of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> our Lord
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2455:139"/>
diſſwading men from hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and double dealing, uſeth this reaſon <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. becauſe how cunningly and ſecretly ſoever men carie their contrivances for the preſent, yet there will a time come, when all their jugling and double dealing ſhall be diſcloſed and layed open in the cleare Sun. The words of the Text in the originall are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

proclaimed on the houſe tops.</hi> Nor are either of theſe tranſlations any whit amiſſe, or any thing different in the ſubſtance. Only, that which ſaith, <hi>ſhall be preached on the houſes,</hi> cometh nearer to the word; and the other, which ſaith, <hi>ſhall be proclaimed,</hi> doth more plainely expreſſe the meaning, and both layed together, do teach us thus much, that to [Preach] ſometimes is nothing elſe, but to proclaime or publiſh a thing, that all may heare and take notice of it. And in this ſenſe reading of the Scriptures, whereof I ſpoke before, may be called prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, without any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or error. Yea, and ſo it is called <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Moſes</hi>

Thus it appeareth that preaching is ſometime uſed in ſuch a generall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as that reading may be called preaching.

reſtrained ſenſe, as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is diſtinguiſhed from reading, and as we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe the word in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſpeech; and that is, when Gods Miniſter doth by an audible voice teach the doctrine of ſalvation in ſuch maner as himſelfe hath contrived and ordered it for the inſtruction of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Note.</hi> This kinde of preaching in the ſtricter and more proper ſenſe, is of two ſorts. For ſometimes men preach, being directed by <hi>inſpiration</hi> or immediat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did preach in the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the New. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2455:142"/>
of the Prophets, that they <hi>ſpake, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And our Saviour ſaith of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>It is not ye that ſpeake, but the ſpirit of your father, which ſpeaketh in you. Matt.</hi> 10.20. Sometimes againe men preach Gods word, as they are enabled by the <hi>rules of art,</hi> and their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie and ſtudie. Thus the Prieſts and Levits did preach, when after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the book of the Law, they <hi>gave the ſenſe, and cauſed the people to underſtand the reading. Nehem.</hi> 8.8. And thus the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes did preach, when <hi>ſitting in Moſes his chaire,</hi> they taught men to keepe and obſerve the things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2455:143"/>
in the Law. <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.2, 3. And this is the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the Doctors and Paſtors of the Church, after the Apoſtles times have uſed, and which Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters do uſe at this day. Of both theſe kindes of preaching, my note is to be underſtood; that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word preached, whether it bee performed by divine inſpiration or by humane ſtudie, is ſtill a meanes to make men happy, that make the right uſe of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Note.</hi> Theſe kindes of preaching, whether by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration or ſtudie, may be performed two wayes. For ſometimes the preacher ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Text of Scripture for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2455:143"/>
the ground of his Sermon. He explaineth the words, and out of them, draweth inſtructions, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth all to the uſe of his hearers. This courſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tooke <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Luk. 4.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> 
                        <hi>He came to Nazareth, where he had beene brought up, and, as his cuſtome was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and ſtood up for to reade. And there was delivered unto him the booke of the Prophet Eſaias: &amp; when he had opened the booke, he found the place where it was written; The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me becauſe he hath annointed mee, to preach the Goſpell to the poore, hee hath ſent me to heale the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2455:144"/>
and recovering of ſight to the blinde, to ſet at libertie them that are bruiſed, to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> In which paſſage wee may obſerve two things. (1.) that our Lord choſe a Text of Scripture to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon: <hi>When hee had opened the booke he found the place, where it was written, The ſpirit, &amp;c. Iſai</hi> 61.1. (2.) that hee unfolded and applied this Text to the preſent occaſion. <hi>This day,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares;</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had foretold in thoſe words, was now fulfilled in himſelfe, who preached unto them, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied of him aforetime.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2455:144"/>
In the like maner <hi>Philip</hi> alſo preached <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32, &amp;c. The Eunuch had read the Text out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.7. <hi>He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi> And then <hi>Philip opened his mouth, and began at the ſame Scripture, and preached unto him Ieſus.</hi> In theſe places it appeareth that <hi>Philip</hi> and our Saviour tooke a Text to preach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the one ſuch a Text, as the occaſion then offered, and the other ſuch as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe made choiſe of for the purpoſe. But at other times wee finde, that preachers have choſen a theame which they thought uſefull for the time, and without any Text, to ground their diſcourſe on, have unfolded that point
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2455:145"/>
out of Scriptures and reaſon, &amp; applied it to the peoples uſe. Thus our Lord did preach, when he made that famous Sermon, called by the learned, <hi>[Sermo Domini in monte,] Our Lords Sermon in the mount,</hi> recorded by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.6, &amp; 7. chapters. For in this Sermon wee have many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Scriptures, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doctrines of religion, and many exhortations and directions for a godly life: but wee finde no Text firſt read, by direction of which he proceeded in his Sermon. Thus our Lord: and ſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preached alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. chapters; and Saint <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. and S. <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 13, &amp; 17. And of later
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2455:145"/>
times, ſome alſo in theſe parts of the Church have done the like; though the common uſe now among us, is alwayes to ground our Sermons upon ſome Text, even then when men ſcarſe once touch upon the Text in the whole Sermon. Of both theſe ſorts of preaching my note is true, that if Gods word bee preached aright, whether by grounding on a Text, or by propounding of a Theame; yet the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word thus prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, is a meanes to make him bleſſed, that uſeth it aright.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme of all is, that the hearing of the word preached, in which of theſe ſorts ſoever it be, is availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2455:146"/>
to bleſſedneſſe, and alike profitable to ſalvation. And the reaſon is, becauſe by every one of them we may bee inſtructed alike in the knowledge of God and his ſervice, and may be edified in the faith of Chriſt, &amp; in the obedience of his Laws; which is the only way, that leadeth to happineſſe and eternall life. Thus much for the firſt point, what wee meane by preaching, or the word preached.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The next is how it may appeare, that the hearing of the word thus preached, is a meanes of bleſſednes. And the anſwere is, it appeareth by theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is the <hi>way</hi>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:2455:146"/>
and the meanes, by which Chriſt hath founded his Church, converted the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſaved the ſoules of beleevers. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>by the fooliſhneſſe of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi> (ſo the world eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it,) <hi>it pleaſed God to ſave them that beleeve.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. And ſo it is ſaid of the Jews, that they did <hi>forbid the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to preach to the Gentiles, that they might bee ſaved.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16. And to theſe ſayings the event proveth anſwerable. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by the preaching of one Sermon converted three thouſand ſoules. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. and S. <hi>Paul</hi> converted many Jews and proſelyts. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.43. and more particularly, and by name he converted
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2455:147"/>
                        <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Gaoler. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. and <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi> and <hi>Damaris</hi> and others. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. And, in a word, by him &amp; his fellow-labourers, all the Chriſtian world have beene brought to the faith. Experience then ſheweth it to be true, that the hearing of the word preached, is a meanes to bring men to the faith, and by faith to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is proved alſo, becauſe God doth ſend preachers into the world, that by their labours hee may bring men to heaven and happineſſe. For this end it is, that God ſent his own Sonne to preach the Goſpell. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God,</hi> (ſaith our Lord in the Prophet,) <hi>is
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:2455:147"/>
upon me, becauſe the Lord hath annointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>they might be called the trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. Iſ.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. In theſe words wee have two things for our purpoſe; (1.) the work, that our Lord Chriſt was ſent about: and that was, <hi>to preach good tidings,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) the end, that was intended and effected by it; &amp; that was two-fold; mans ſanctification, and Gods glory: <hi>that they might bee called the trees of righteouſnes, and that hee might be glorified by it.</hi> And for the like end and purpoſe, our Lord Chriſt himſelfe did ſend his Apoſtles to preach, <hi>Matt.</hi>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:2455:148"/>
10.5, 7: and the ſeventie Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.1. and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. And to ſave labour in naming of particulars, the Apoſtle telleth us, that when our Lord was aſcended up into heaven, <hi>hee gave ſome to bee Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers.</hi> But why and for what end all this? why, it was, (ſaith the Text,) <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the miniſtery, &amp; for the edifying of the body of Chriſt: till we all come in the unitie of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. By this we ſee,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2455:148"/>
that as the Apoſtles did bring men to the faith by their preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the beginning: ſo God hath eſtabliſhed a ſetled courſe of teaching to the worlds end; by which men may bee brought to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eternall life. And thus much for anſwere to the ſecond queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The laſt is, What help may we have by hearing the word preached, beſide or more then wee might gaine by hearing the Scriptures read? To this my anſwere is, it may furtherus in the way of godlineſſe diverſe wayes, over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the benefit that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the word read. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It may further us for the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:2455:149"/>
right underſtanding of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſages of Scripture, more then we could gather by hearing of them read. For though the principles of faith and rules of a good life be delivered clearely &amp; plainely in Scriptures, and a man by reading or hearing them read, may gaine much help toward ſalvation: yet it is true alſo that there are many ſpeeches &amp; phraſes &amp; words, which are not eaſily underſtood by an ordinary Chriſtian; but may be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; made cleare by a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preacher. For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, the diſciples underſtood not the right meaning of that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Prophet, <hi>Behold, I will ſend you Eliiah the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, before the coming of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2455:149"/>
great and dreadfull day of the Lord: and hee ſhall turne the heart of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c. Malac.</hi> 4.5. For they conceited that this was meant of <hi>Elias</hi> in perſon, whereas it was meant of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> who came in the <hi>ſpirit and power of Elias;</hi> and becauſe hee reſembled him in his office is therefore called by his name. This when they underſtood not, our LORD expounded it unto them, and made them to know the true meaning of that Scripture, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.12. Againe, the Eunuch of Ethiopia did not underſtand that ſaying of <hi>Iſai, (cap.</hi> 53. <hi>v.</hi> 7.) <hi>He was led as a Sheepe to the ſlaughter, and like a Lambe dumb before his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2455:150"/>
ſhearer, ſo opened hee not his mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.32. but when <hi>Philip</hi> came, and expounded the Text, and preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him JESUS out of that Text, then he underſtood the words and beleeved in CHRIST to ſalvation. And ſo among us, there is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chriſtian, but may ſtick at the meaning of ſom Scriptures, which, if a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preacher have them in handling, hee may ſee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and explained.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By hearing the word preached a man may learne how this or that Scripture doth prove and confirme a point of divinity, or doth confute a contrary errour, or doth commend unto us ſome profitable dutie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2455:150"/>
to our calling; which a common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of and by himſelf would not have marked and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. For example, the Sadduces and common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that time, did not ſee, nor could not conceive how the Reſurrection of the dead might be proved out of that ſaying of <hi>Moſes (Exod.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Iacob.</hi> But our Saviour ſheweth it by a plaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that that Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the truth of that point, becauſe that <hi>God is not the God of the dead but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> Whence it foloweth, that becauſe God ſaith, that he <hi>is the God of Abraham, and Iſaac, and Iacob,</hi> therefore
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2455:151"/>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob</hi> are living ſtill, and conſequently their ſoules were not peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed or vaniſhed into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as the Sadduces fondly imagined, and therefore ſaid that there was no Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Againe, the people did not know, that that place of <hi>David, Thou ſhalt not leave my ſoule in hell, nor ſuffer thine holy one to ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, (Pſal.</hi> 16.10.) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any proofe of Chriſts Reſurrection from the dead. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth and that from the Text it ſelfe, that this ſaying muſt needes bee meant of Chriſt, who upon the third day after his death, roſe againe from the dead, without any tincture of cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption; becauſe of <hi>David</hi>
                        <pb n="271" facs="tcp:2455:151"/>
that Text could not bee meant, who had beene a long time dead, and now was conſumed into aſhes, but never roſe againe from the place of corruption, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.36. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.29. And ſo in like ſort, there are many paſſages of holy writ, which yeeld plaine proofe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of ſome truth, or for confuting of ſome error, or for inſtructing us in ſome duty; which an unlearned man among us cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by himſelfe, but may learne it from a ſkilfull preacher.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By hearing the word preached we may learn how to applie the ſayings of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to our owne uſe, more then by hearing it read we
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2455:152"/>
could ever be able to do of our ſelves. For Scriptures teach us generall duties, and give us generall rules, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring how they agree to each age or place or perſon. For that were an infinit labour, and not to be performed at once. Now theſe rules and theſe ſayings the unlearned do not know how to apply, ſo well as the preacher can teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them. Nor will the learned bee ready to make application to themſelves, till ſome monitor remember them of their dutie. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof wee have in our bleſſed Saviour, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read that place of the Prophet, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, &amp;c. Iſ.</hi> 61.1:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2455:152"/>
preſently applieth it in ſuch a manner, as the hearers would never have thought of: <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares. Luk.</hi> 4.21. An other example to the ſame purpoſe we have in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>I have heard thee in an acceptable time, &amp;c:</hi> he preſently teacheth the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> (which before they knew not;) how to apply it to the preſent time and occaſion: <hi>Behold now,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is that accepted time; now is the day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. To theſe we may add the example of <hi>David.</hi> He no doubt, had oftentimes read of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God againſt adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2455:153"/>
and murder; nor could he be ignorant how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary repentance was for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of that judgment: but hee neglected to apply theſe rules to himſelfe, to whom they properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed; till <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him, and applied them to his conſcience, and tould him in plaine words, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                     <p>By all this wee may ſee, that there is great benefit in hearing the word preached, beſides that which may bee gotten by the word read. And hereof there is plaine reaſon alſo.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe the preacher is ſuppoſed to bee bred and brought up in learning, and thereby hath gained ſkill to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2455:153"/>
underſtand thoſe things which belong to his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For even in ordinary trades, he that hath been an Apprentice for ſeven years, may bee ſuppoſed to have gained ſkill both to manage his trade, and to traine up others in the knowledge of the ſame art: which they will not be able to doe, who were never bred up in that profeſſion. And ſo it is in this caſe. If a man have ſpent ſundrie years, perhaps twiſe ſeven or upward, in the ſtudy of Divinity, (as many of our preachers have;) in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability and likelihood, that man will be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand &amp; teach points, much better then men whoſe bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath beene in an other
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2455:154"/>
kinde. But if any ſhall ſtepp into the Pulpit, before he have paſſed through the Schooles, and take upon him to teach Divinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ever learned it; I ſpeake not of ſuch a one, nor do I think him fitt to teach men the myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Such a man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps pleaſe the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who eſteeme more of a glibb tongue, then a ſolid braine, &amp; are ſwayed more with ſound of words then with weight of reaſons: but will never either ſatisfie the judgment of the learned, or direct any mans conſcience in the wayes of ſalvation. Underſtand mee then to ſpeake of ſuch a one, as hath beene bred in the ſtudy of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2455:154"/>
good arts, and is (as the Apoſtle calleth him,) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, apt to teach, and then yee will confeſſe it to bee true, that ſuch a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher will bee able to teach his hearers the meaning of Gods word, better then they of themſelves could learne and underſtand it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the preacher, beſides his former ſtudies, doth or ſhould beſtow his time on the weeke dayes, to provide for his labours on the Lords day or other feſtivals. Other men ſpend the weeke on their worldly buſineſſe, the merchant on his traffick, the huſbandman on his tillage, the handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts man on his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2455:155"/>
the Lawyer on his Clients, the Phyſician on his patients; and reſerve only the Lords day for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Religion. But the imployment of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, even on the week day, is to turne his bookes, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Text, and ſtudie for matter of inſtruction that may do his people good; that when the Lords day is come, he may ſpeake perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the purpoſe, and profitably for the furthering of his peoples ſoules. And ſuch a man will bee more able to expound Scriptures, to ſtate a controverſie, and to give rules of a godly life; then any other can do, who hath not ſtudied the points aforehand, and turned over
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2455:155"/>
his bookes for his better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. But if there bee any of us preachers, who ſtudie the world on the week daies, and then preach on Gods day what commeth next to our lips: I ſpeake not of ſuch, nor dare I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them for men that may direct Gods people in the way of godlineſſe; no, nor them neither, who value their labours by the number of Sermons which they preach, rather then by the ſolid notes of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they do deliver. Such men may pleaſe idle profeſſors, who make their religion an eare-labour, as Papiſts make their prayers a lip-labour. But underſtand me of ſuch preachers, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2455:156"/>
their former ſtudies, do beſtow the weeke dayes for proviſion on the Lords day; and no man will denie, but ſuch are more able to teach godlineſſe, then they who have ſpent all the week on profane or worldly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. There is great reaſon then, to thinke, that the learned preacher may teach us more of Gods truth, then poſſibly we could learne by our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>And out of all this, wee may obſerve the great mercy of God towards us, and his great love to our ſoules, who hath provided ſuch varietie of meanes to bring us to happineſſe and eternall glory. Firſt, he hath given us opportunitie of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2455:156"/>
reading his word at home in a knowen tongue: and then hee hath provided us meanes that wee may heare it read in the publik congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and laſtly, that both the publik and privat rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may bee made more profitable and uſefull, hee ſendeth his preachers to guide us in the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and applying of his word; as he ſent <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, to inſtruct him in the faith. And if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, wee neglect ſo great ſalvation offered unto us; how ſhall we eſcape the juſt judgment of God, who commanded the <hi>unprofitable ſervant to bee caſt into outer darkneſſe, where is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2455:157"/>
for ſuch a neglect God complaineth of the Jews, as of men that had deſpiſed both his mercies and their owne comforts. <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have written unto them the great things of my Law; but they were counted as a ſtrange thing. Hoſ.</hi> 8.12. Where (1.) when he ſaith, <hi>I have written the great things of my Law,</hi> he putteth them in minde, that his word is not a thing of ſmall value or not worth the reckoning and eſteeme. But as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of his Law, <hi>It is no vaine thing for you; becauſe it is your life. Deuter.</hi> 32.47: So our God telleth his people, that his word was no vaine, or idle thing; but the things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained were <hi>great things,</hi>
                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:2455:157"/>
matters of life and eternall happineſſe. (2.) When hee ſaith, <hi>I have written</hi> unto them theſe great things, he implieth that theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie things are hard at hand, lying by them in ſtore, that they may take up the Bible, and read and learne thoſe rules and directions, that may carie them into heaven. (3.) When he addeth; <hi>But they,</hi> [theſe <hi>great things of my Law,] were counted, as a ſtrange thing,</hi> he upbraideth the people with their great negligence, or contempt rather, that having ſuch a faire opportunity, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed ſo great ſalvation, as if it were a matter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them not.</p>
                     <p>And ſo it will bee with
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2455:158"/>
us Chriſtians; if we neglect either to read Gods word by our ſelves in privat, or to heare it read in publik, now that we have it ſo faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and legibly written for our uſes, God may chide us for our contempt of his mercies, &amp; that upon better grounds and with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then hee did chide the Jews. For (1.) he wrote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede <hi>great things</hi> for them, but they are farre greater things that he hath written for us. They had the books of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in CHRIST and ſalvation were ſcantly and obſcurely taught: but we beſides thoſe books have the writings of the Evangeliſts &amp; Apoſtles, wherein CHRIST JESUS
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2455:158"/>
is <hi>crucified before our eyes,</hi> &amp; wee are brought into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> that wee may ſee God, as it were with open face. In reſpect of which cleare light it is, that <hi>Kings and Prophets have deſired to ſee thoſe things, which wee ſee, and have not ſeene them:</hi> Nay the very <hi>Angels</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did <hi>deſire to looke into thoſe things,</hi>

great coſt in the Buyer, and ſome ſkill in the reader of it. But ſince God hath ſent printing into the world, we may purchaſe the whole Bible at a leſſe price, then our fathers could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained S. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell alone, and every boy &amp; girle may reade with readineſſe and ſpeede that which the learned might ſtumble or ſtopp at. The ſumme is, God offereth us a greater treaſure at an eaſier rate; and, if now wee deſpiſe or ſet light by ſuch a mercie, God may complaine of us, with more reaſon then hee did of the Jews; <hi>I have written to them the great things of my Law; but they are counted with them as a ſtrange thing.</hi>

                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:2455:160"/>Againe, God upbraideth the Jews, for an other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the like mercie. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith Jeremie) <hi>ſent unto you his ſervants the Prophets, riſing earely and ſending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your eare to heare. Ier.</hi> 25.4. Hee meaneth, that beſides the Law written, hee ſent the Prophets to preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and applie that Law unto them; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned all, as things of no value. And is it not ſo with us too? God hath ſent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in abundance; and what uſe wee have made of their labours, let him judge, that knoweth what our dealings be. I onely will ſay, how ſhall wee eſcape
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2455:161"/>
Gods anger, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</p>
                     <p>It importeth us then to make uſe of theſe mercies, which being uſed aright may help to make us bleſſed, and being neglected may breede no ſmall danger. For our better direction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, beſides what hath beene ſaid already, wee may take theſe further obſervations or rules.</p>
                     <p>If God give us the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of theſe helps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as to moſt of us he hath; we muſt not ſeparate in our practice thoſe things, which God hath joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his precept. It is our dutie to reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at home, and it is no leſſe our duty to heare them
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2455:161"/>
read in the Church; and a duty alſo it is, to heare the word preached. All of them have their uſe, all of them are commended to us in the Scriptures, &amp; all of them are availeable for ſalvation: and conſequently all of them are to be made uſe of by us in the fitt ſeaſon. If any man ſhall ſett Gods ordinances together by the eares, and is either ſo addicted to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat reading, that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth publik hearing, or ſo honoreth the word prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched, that hee neglecteth the word read; I may ſay to him, and all ſuch as hee is, as<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iam. 2.4, 11.</note> S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaid in a like caſe, <hi>Ye are partiall in your ſelfes, and are become Iudges of evill thoughts. For he that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2455:162"/>
ſaid,</hi> Heare the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, ſaid alſo, Heare the word read, yea, and reade it in your privat dwellings: and therefore, if ye heare it preached, &amp; will not heare it read, ye are become <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the Law.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, They that will be bleſſed, may not make a divorce betweene thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, which God hath made joint helps to a bleſſed life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If neceſſitie do at any time force us to forbeare ſome of theſe helps, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt teach us to make the more diligent uſe of the reſt. For example, if ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſome unavoidable neceſſitie do keepe us from hearing in the Church, wee
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2455:162"/>
muſt bee the more diligent in reading at home. And if want of education in our younger dayes hath left us unable to reade Scriptures by our ſelves, wee muſt be the more carefull to heare them read by others. And if attendance on children or other neceſſary occaſions cauſe us to keepe our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at home, when others are buſied in the ſervice of the Church, we ſhould do our endevour to ſupplie the loſſe of publik inſtructions by our privat admonitions, and by rehearſing to them at home thoſe good directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which our ſelves did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the publik mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.

For clearing of which point two things are neceſſarie to be knowen; 1. How farre wee may and muſt keepe Gods word that we may be bleſſed. 2. How this keeping of Gods word is availeable

What it is to keepe Gods word, (2.) how farre in this life a man is able to keep it; and (3.) Whence we have abilitie to keepe it in ſuch ſort.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What it is to keepe Gods word.</p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> This word <hi>[to keepe]</hi> when it is applied to ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or doctrines, as in this place it is, hath two uſes in Scripture. For it ſignifieth either to keep in minde and memorie, or to keep in our life and practice.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>minde and memorie</hi> we
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2455:164"/>
kepe it, when with care we committ and laie it up in memorie, &amp; do often think on it, and revolve it in our mindes. Thus the bleſſed Virgin kept what ſhee had heard concerning her Sonne and our Saviour. For ſo it is ſaid, that the Shepheards of Bethleem, upon the viſion that they had ſeene, and the words that the Angels had ſpoken unto them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the birth of CHRIST, <hi>Came to Bethleem with haſte, and found Mary and Ioſeph &amp; the Babe lying in a manger. And when they had ſeene it, they made knowen abroad the ſaying that was tould them concerning this childe.</hi> Then the Text addeth, <hi>But Mary kept all theſe things and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2455:165"/>
them in her heart. Luk.</hi> 2.16, 17, 19. And in the ſame chapter <hi>ver.</hi> 51. When ſhee had found her Sonne JESUS being then but twelve years of age, ſitting in the Temple, and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and diſputing with the Doctors; and alledging for his ſo doing, that he <hi>muſt be about his fathers buſineſſe:</hi> his Mother, ſaith the Text, <hi>kept all theſe ſayings in her heart.</hi> The meaning is, ſhee layed them up in her memorie, and often thought on them in her minde.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we keep Gods word in life and <hi>practice,</hi> when we do that which God in his word requireth to be done by us. Thus the word is uſed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.10. where

and ſollicitude, that the word which wee have heard, do not ſlipp from us and be forgotten.</hi> But to my thinking the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell in the Revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrueth it in the later ſenſe or ſignification, when ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering for ſubſtance the very ſame ſentence, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour uſed in this place, he expreſſeth it in theſe words; <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, that they may have right to the tree of life, &amp;c.</hi> And ſurely the common uſe of the word in this ſenſe, and the intention of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ſpeech being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Scripture, and the generall ſtreame of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, who run this way, may perſwade any man,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2455:167"/>
and do give mee ſufficient warrant to underſtand this word in the later ſenſe; and to ſay, that to <hi>keep Gods word</hi> in this place is as much <hi>as to do it, and obey it.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I will grant thus much to D. <hi>Rivet,</hi> that the ſenſe which he putteth upon the word, may be included or implied in this place, if wee conſtrue the words to this purpoſe, <hi>They are bleſſed,</hi> who ſo keepe Gods word in their memories, that they may keepe it in their life, and practice. But then the keeping of it in memorie is but onely intimated; and the keeping of it in practice is principally and mainely intended in the Text. In a word then, to <hi>keep Gods word,</hi>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:2455:167"/>
is to do and performe what it commandeth or requireth to be done. And ſo much be ſaid to the firſt queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> The ſecond is, But can any man in this life be able thus to keepe or do Gods word? And it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, no. For S. <hi>Iames</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offendeth in one point; hee is guiltie of all. Iam.</hi> 2.10: and not long after he telleth us further, <hi>In many things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all. Iam.</hi> 3.2. It followeth, Therefore there is no man, but is guilty of the breach of the whole Law: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, no man can keep it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> For anſwer to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and objection, we muſt note, that there is a twofold
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2455:168"/>
keeping of Gods word or commandments; the one a Legall, &amp; the other an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall keeping of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Firſt, there is a <hi>Legall</hi> keeping: and that is, when wee keep and performe the commandements ſo exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, as is anſwerable to the rigour of the Law, and as the rule of Juſtice doth require. And this exactneſſe conſiſteth in three things. (1.) That our obedience be <hi>univerſall</hi> in reſpect of the object; or that every thing commanded by God, bee performed by us, without failing in any one point. For, if the Law be conſidered in it ſelfe, and without mercie from CHRIST to mitigat the rigour of it; it then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2455:168"/>
a curſe againſt every offence without any exception. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">So the Originall hath it: &amp; ſo the vulgar la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Vata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus,</hi> &amp;c. do render it: though our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, I know not upon what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, doth add the word <hi>(all) that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth not all the words of this Law,</hi> which is agreable to the meaning, but not to the words.</note> 
                        <hi>Curſed is he that confirmeth not the words of this Law, to do them. Deut.</hi> 27.26. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> alledging this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, rendreth the ſenſe of it thus, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, which are written in the booke of the Law, to do them. Gal.</hi> 3.10. Where, by ſaying, <hi>All things, which are</hi> written,—hee teacheth us, that the Law in that ſentence meant the curſe againſt any one onely ſin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt that Law. And accordingly we ſee, it was but one ſin alone, that caſt the Angels out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>Adam</hi> out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2455:169"/>
(2.) The exact rule of the Law doth require that our obedience bee <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall</hi> in reſpect of the time; or, that wee performe not onely all the things, that are commanded, but at all times, while the Law is in force and doth require them to be done. For he that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth once only in all his life, confirmeth not all things, becauſe then he diſanulleth or diſobeyeth ſomething in the Law, whenſoever he performeth not what the Law doth command. And therefore the Apoſtle alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that former ſentence of <hi>Deuteronomie, Curſed is hee that confirmeth not the words,</hi> rendreth it thus, <hi>Curſed is hee that continueth not in all
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2455:169"/>
things;</hi> implying hereby, that the meaning of the Law is, that he is accurſed, who at any time tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Law, though it bee but once in all his life. And this againe is verified in the example of <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels. For the ſin that caſt the Angels out of Heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, was but once committed by them in all their life. (3.) The Law, in the rigour thereof doth require, that our obedience bee <hi>full</hi> and <hi>complete</hi> in reſpect of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meaſure of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: or that it bee with all the heart, and with all the ſoule, and the utmoſt intenſion and affection of the heart, that God ought
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2455:170"/>
to bee obeyed withall, by men in this mortall life. For if a man come ſhort in any degree that is required in our obedience, therein hee hath broken that part of the Law, which requireth all: and conſequently, by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his rule, he is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the Law, &amp; ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth guiltie of the breach of it. Now, put all theſe together: and the ſumme will be this, that the Legall keeping of Gods word requireth that it be done in all things, and at all times, and in the moſt exacteſt maner, that in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is due or can be exacted at our hands. And this is that which I call the <hi>Legall</hi> kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Gods word. But thus and in this ſenſe never
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2455:170"/>
any man was able to keepe the Law, ſave only the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> while he ſtood in his innocency, and CHRIST the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who never loſt it. This alſo is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed by that of the Apoſtle, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>that no man is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law in the ſight of God. Gal.</hi> 3.11. and <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that <hi>as many as are of the workes of the Law, are under the curſe;</hi> becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Curſed is every one, &amp;c.</hi> Hee meaneth, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is to bee judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the Law without mercie procured by CHRIST for the miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this rigour, and for a favourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law; that man
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2455:171"/>
is in a curſed and damnable eſtate; becauſe no man on earth can ever bee able to keepe the Law in this exact maner. And hence it is, that the Angels, who were liable to this exact rule of Gods Law, and by their creation were made able ſo to performe it; becauſe they committed one ſinne againſt it, &amp; that once one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were rejected without mercie. And ſo <hi>Adam,</hi> being by his creation in the like ſtate and condition, that is, alike ſubject to the exact rule of the Law; for one offence once committed by him, was caſt out of Gods favour, and ſhould have ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ever, for any help that the Law or the rule of
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2455:171"/>
juſtice could afford him. And had not CHRIST our Lord come in as a Mediator to make peace and eſtabliſh a new covenant of grace, far different from that of the Law; both hee and wee all had periſhed, and beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe for evermore. Thus wee ſee, what the legall keeping of Gods word is: and that no man living is able to keepe it in this ſenſe. And therefore this is not the keeping, which our Saviour commendeth unto us in this place, as a meanes, that may make us bleſſed, when hee ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. But ſecondly, there is another kinde of keeping of Gods word, called by the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2455:172"/>
Learned, <hi>Evangelicall:</hi> and that is, when we ſo keep &amp; performe this word &amp; Law of God, as CHRIST doth require in the Goſpell, and as God for CHRISTS ſake doth accept at our hands, in ſteede of that other of the Law. Now this rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience preſcribed in the Goſpell doth mitigate the rule and rigor of the Law in two things. (1.) Becauſe it granteth a pardon to ſome kinde of ſinnes: and (2.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it accepteth of a mans repentance after any the moſt hainous ſin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It granteth a pardon to ſome ſinnes. For though it allow or approve no ſin, yet it pronounceth not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt every ſin: as
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:2455:172"/>
namely not againſt any ſins of <hi>infirmitie;</hi> ſuch as are ſins of ignorance; which had we knowen, wee would not have committed; and ſinnes of ſubreption, which eſcape without obſerving of them, and which, if we had noted and obſerved, we would not have done them; and ſinnes of violent tentation, which by reaſon of ſome ſudden aſſault, do ſway our paſſions againſt the right rule, and ſometimes by feare, and ſometimes by joy, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by hopes, do carie us away, before wee have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to bethink our ſelves, and in coole blood to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what wee are a doing. Such ſins, as theſe, Divines call ſinnes of infirmitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2455:173"/>
they ariſe not out of an evill purpoſe of the minde, but out of humane frailtie, from which wee ſhall never be free, as long as we live in this body of corruption. And if men committ ſuch ſinnes, as theſe; the Goſpell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the ſinnes as evill, &amp; repugnant to Gods Law, but it condemneth not the ſinner for them, ſo long as he diſliketh and deteſteth them in his ſober thoughts and reſolution. Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, when ſpeaking of ſuch like ſinnes, hee cried out as a man undone; <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom.</hi> 7.24. For ſuch ſinnes as theſe, the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2455:173"/>
Goſpell condemneth us not: it onely condemneth men for deliberat content, when they yeeld obedience to knowen ſinne, and againſt conſcience tranſgreſſe the Law.</p>
                     <p>From hence it is, that the Apoſtle, delivering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the rule of the Goſpel, ſaith; <hi>Let not ſinne therefore reigne in your mortall bodies, that yee ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof. Rom.</hi> 6.12. In this paſſage, when he ſaith, <hi>Let not ſin;</hi> by this word he meaneth the inbred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, which wee brought with us into the world, and that habit of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, which wee have ſince contracted by our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in ſinning, and by
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2455:174"/>
which we are every day ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to the practice of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſin. And becauſe this ſinfulneſſe doth tempt and ſway men to ſin, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith of it, <hi>Let not ſin reigne, &amp;c.</hi> (2.) when he ſaith of this ſinfulnes, <hi>Let it not reigne</hi> in your mortall bodies, he meaneth that it ſhould not beare ſway, and carie away our conſent, to act what it ſuggeſteth, and to do what it commandeth. So S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> expounds this word. [<hi>Non dixit,</hi> Non ſit, <hi>ſed,</hi> Non regnet. <hi>Ineſt pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum, quum delectaris; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnat, ſi conſenſeris.</hi>] The The Apoſtle, <hi>ſaid not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>Let not ſin bee in your mortall bodies; but let it not reigne.</hi> It is in thee <hi>when it

tickleth with delight; but it reigneth in thee if it draw thee to conſent. Auguſt. in Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>pag.</hi> 175. B. Yea, and ſo the Apoſtle expoundeth his own meaning, when hee addeth in the next words, <hi>Let not ſin reigne that ye ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof: noting</hi> hereby, as a learned<note n="(a)" place="margin">D. Abbot, true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik, cap. 11. pag. 281.</note> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat of our Church hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) <hi>that then ſin is ſaid to reigne in us, when we give obedience to it, to fulfill the luſts thereof.</hi> (3.) In that the Apoſtle ſaith not, Let not ſin be within you, or, Let it not tempt you, or, Let it not pleaſe and tickle you with delight; but <hi>Let it not reigne</hi> in you, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you <hi>to obey it:</hi> this giveth us to underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that though
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2455:175"/>
it be a miſerie to be tempted by our luſts, and a ſin to bee tickled and delighted with them, when we are tempted by them; yet the Apoſtle now delivering the precepts of the Goſpell, and the rules, by which Chriſtians, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>new Covenant</hi> of grace are to bee regulated, doth not charge men ſo deepely, as to forbid them all tickling delights: he only requireth that ſinne do <hi>not reigne,</hi> and that men do not <hi>obey it</hi> by conſenting unto it. This is the rule preſcribed by the Goſpell, and here commended to us by our Apoſtle, and as <hi>many, as walke according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon them, as upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> Other
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2455:175"/>
ſinnes, ſuch as I called ſins of infirmitie or humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to which we do not give deliberat conſent, theſe are pardoned in the blood of the Lamb. But if any man ſin againſt this rule, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſin, or acting it; and ſo ſuffer ſin to reigne in him: the Apoſtles ſentence will take holde on him, <hi>Bee not deceived: Neither forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor idolaters, nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, nor effeminat, nor abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of themſelves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, nor thieves, nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, nor drunkards, nor revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, nor extortioners, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. This explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point was for the ſubſtance of it long ſince delivered by the learned

                     </p>
                     <p>This then is one thing, wherein the Goſpell doth moderat the rigour of the Law; that whereas the Law requireth perfect obedience in every point, &amp; for every breach pronounceth a curſe and a damnatory ſentence; the Goſpell beareth with the ſinner, and pardoneth him his ſinnes of infirmitie and humane frailtie, if ſo be, he giveth not approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or aſſent thereto in his coole blood and deliberat thoughts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, the Goſpell doth herein mitigat the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour

of the Law, becauſe the Law for one offence once committed, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a man without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him any way or meanes of recovery: but the Goſpell on the contrary ſide accepteth of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance giveth him a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.

for the performance of his will; but indeede are not. The later of theſe, that is, Grace, is the true principle of obedience; &amp; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is planted, doth enable the ſoule, to keepe Gods commandements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Evangelicall and favourable conſtruction of the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>This is proved in both the parts thereof by that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. Where ſpeaking of the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of nature, hee ſaith, <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned.</hi> In which paſſage of the Apoſtle, wee
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2455:181"/>
may note (1.) the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Apoſtle, <hi>The naturall man doth not, neither can hee receive the things of Gods ſpirit.</hi> He meaneth, that though a man ſhould teach and inſtruct him in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſalvation, yet hee is uncapeable of inſtruction; hee doth not acknowledge their truth, neither can he conceive the myſtery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them. And if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know and acknowledge them, much leſſe can hee do and performe, what they require at his hands. (2.) we may note the reaſon or the proofe hereof, and that is, becauſe the <hi>myſteries of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are fooliſhneſſe to the</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man; and the reaſon againe thereof is, becauſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2455:182"/>
                        <hi>they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> By this it appeareth, that the onely principle, which enableth a man for the right judging and diſcerning of heavenly things, is the grace of Gods Spirit, which the naturall man wanteth. And hence it followeth, that as a man cannot live without a ſoule, nor ſee without an eye, nor heare without an eare becauſe theſe are the grounds &amp; principles, from which life and ſight and hearing do flow: ſo no man can know and ſerve God aright without Gods Spirit enlightening and enabling him by his grace, becauſe this is the principle, from which all both ſpiritual acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and abilities do ſpring.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2455:182"/>
The like to this wee have againe in the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Wee are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of our ſelves, to think any thing, as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> Here the Apoſtle firſt removeth the falſe principle, <hi>Wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves;</hi> No, not to <hi>think a good thought,</hi> much leſſe to do the good workes that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in GODS Law. (2.) Hee laieth downe the true principle of all our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in Gods ſervice, <hi>Our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>I can do all things through</hi> CHRIST, <hi>that ſtrengtheneth mee. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> 4.13. And 1 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> 15.10. <hi>By the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2455:183"/>
grace of God I am what I am: and his grace was not in mee in vaine: but I laboured more abundantly then they all; yet not I, but the grace of God, that was with mee.</hi> Where (1.) when hee ſaith, <hi>His grace was</hi> not in <hi>me in vaine,</hi> but <hi>I laboured, &amp;c.</hi> he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what he could and did do; that is, hee ſerved God with great zele in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpell. And (2.) when he ſaith, <hi>Yet not I but the grace</hi> of God, &amp;c. he ſheweth what the ground of this labouring facultie in him was: and that both ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively by removing the falſe ground, <hi>Yet not I,</hi> that is, not I as I, or, not I of or by my ſelfe: and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, by ſetting downe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2455:183"/>
the true ground, Not I, but <hi>the grace of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The concluſion of all is; By nature and of our ſelves, we can not do Gods will, or keepe his word, ſo as may be accepted of him; becauſe by nature <hi>we are dead in ſinne, &amp; by nature we are children of wrath:</hi> but by the grace of God in JESUS CHRIST, enabling us thereto, we can and do keepe the word of God according to the rule of the Goſpell, and ſo as it is accepted of God to eternall life.</p>
                     <p>From hence wee may ſee the great priviledges that a Chriſtian man and woman hath by being in CHRIST; more then the reſt of the world have: for
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2455:184"/>
example, (to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhort liſt of them) ſuch as theſe are.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He is endued with power from above to keepe Gods word and do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, which the reſt of the world who are out of CHRIST, can not do. For (1.) they do not know, nor can they diſcerne the things of God. But God <hi>reveileth them to his children by the Spirit.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. (2.) By nature and of themſelves men cannot think a good thought: but God <hi>worketh</hi> in his children <hi>both to will and to do that which is good. Phil.</hi> 2.13. And laſtly, of our ſelves and by the power of nature, wee know not how to pray for the things that
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2455:184"/>
we want, as we ought: but the <hi>Spirit helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us with groanings, that can not be expreſſed. Rom.</hi> 8.26. Thus the childe of God, by grace received from his heavenly father, is enabled to ſerve God for the ſaving of his ſoule, which abilitie they have not, who have not CHRIST for their Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The childe of God hath this priviledge above others, that the ſervice, which he doth by the helpe of grace, though it be weak and unperfect, yet being upright and ſincere, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, as if it were perfect and wanted
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:2455:185"/>
nothing. For of him that is meant, which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If there bee a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that, that he hath not.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Thoſe ſentences of Gods word, which are <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally</hi> meant of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat man, and therefore containe a curſe againſt him: are <hi>Evangelically</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe, which are in CHRIST, and ſerve to direct him by the way of righteouſneſſe to eternall life. For example, that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 27.26.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein he requireth a performance of all things that are written in the Law, if it be applied to a man out of CHRIST,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:2455:185"/>
it carieth in it the ſentence of his condemnation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he keepeth not nor can not keep that Law: and therefore hee remaineth liable to the Curſe, there denounced. <hi>Curſed is every one, that confirmeth not, &amp;c.</hi> And to this purpoſe, the Apoſtle urgeth this place <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. But if the ſame ſentence bee applied to a true Chriſtian; it ſpeaketh no condemnation to him, it is rather a commendation of his integrity and piety; becauſe hee keepeth this Law, ſo as God requireth of him in the Goſpell. In this ſenſe, it is ſaid of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that they <hi>walked in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements and ordinances of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2455:186"/>
of the Lord blameleſſe. Luk.</hi> 1.6. And ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Ioſias,</hi> that he <hi>turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moſes.</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.25.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges do belong to him, who is engraffed into CHRIST: and by theſe, he may encourage himſelfe in his calling, and ſtirre up his heart to chereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Gods ſervice, who hath beene ſo gratious unto him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, ſeeing all our abilitie of keeping of Gods word, commeth only from Gods grace; we may hence learn whom to thank
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:2455:186"/>
for all the good works that we do. Out of this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it is that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid, <hi>I laboured more abundantly then they all;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently addeth in the next words, <hi>yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with mee.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. And ſo, if any of us bee more fervent and frequent in prayers, then others be, and more ſtrict in the rules of conſcience then they be, and more plentifull in the deeds of charitie: he ſhould ſtill remember to add after all; <hi>And yet, it is not I that do this, but the grace of God,</hi> that is with mee: that ſo God, who giveth all, may be praiſed for all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing all our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of keeping Gods word,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:2455:187"/>
is from Gods grace; wee ſhould againe learne, when we want any grace, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go for helpe and ſupply. If wee want water, we go to the Conduit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is the well head, whence the water floweth: and if wee want health, wee go to the Phyſician, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the knowledge of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and remedies is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be in him: and if wee bee wronged and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, we go to the Juſtice or the Magiſtrate, becauſe he hath the ſword, that can right and relieve us. And ſo, if <hi>any of you lack wiſedome,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iames) let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, Iam.</hi> 1.5. And ſo ſay I, If any among us do want
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:2455:187"/>
knowledge, to direct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Gods ſervice; let him go by his prayers, to God, who <hi>enlighteneth every man that commeth into the world.</hi> And if he want pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to beare the croſſe, let him go to him for mercy, who is the God <hi>of all patience and comfort.</hi> And if hee want ſtrength to withſtand a tentation; let him go to him, who <hi>ſuffereth</hi> not his ſervants to <hi>bee tempted above their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, but together with the tentation maketh a way for them to eſcape,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.13.</note> 
                        <hi>that they may bee able to beare it.</hi> And in a word, if any man want any grace, let him go to him, who is the God of all grace, &amp; from whom <hi>cometh every good &amp; perfect gift.</hi> If we pray
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2455:188"/>
to him for grace, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for help, and ſubmit to him in the uſe of the meanes; there is no doubt, but hee hath what we want, and will do that which we deſire.</p>

                        <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>[II.] The ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall point concerning the keeping of Gods word, is, how and wherein this kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Law is availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to happineſſe and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
                     <p>To this queſtion the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, that it availeth or conduceth to happineſſe two wayes: (1.) as a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion qualifying mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for this glorious eſtate. And (2.) as a ſervice, which God rewardeth with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory.</p>

                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:2455:188"/>I. Firſt it conduceth, as a <hi>condition</hi> required to bee in them that are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven. For though God be liberall and bountifull in beſtowing of his gifts; and uſeth to give more, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we deſerve or deſire: yet hee is no prodigall or waſtfull ſpender, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth them not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, without reſpecting who and what the men be, that partake of his favours: but he maketh choiſe of ſuch as bee fit and in ſome ſenſe<note n="*" place="margin">I meane a worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which maketh a man fitt to receive a favour; and not a worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which maketh him able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</note> worthy of ſuch mercies. The Philoſopher ſaid <hi>[Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facta malè locata malefacta ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitror,] Good deedes ill placed</hi> (and ſo they are, when they are beſtowed on unworthy men;) <hi>I count to be evill, not

But, as when the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> deſired to <hi>ſitt, one on</hi> CHRISTS <hi>right, and an other on his left hand in his Kingdome;</hi> our LORD an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thoſe importunat Beggers, <hi>To ſitt upon my right hand and upon my left, is not mine to give, but it ſhall bee given to them, for whom it is prepared of my Father.

Kingdome, it ſhall be given to them onely, for whom God hath prepared it. And who thoſe bee, our Saviour hath tould us, when he ſaith, <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave me meate, I was thirſty, and ye gave mee drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in, &amp;c. Matt.</hi> 25.34. Where (1.) when he ſaith, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, receive the Kingdom prepared for you:</hi> he ſheweth that they are bleſſed men, and partakers of Gods Kingdome for whom God had prepared it long before. And (2.) when he ſaith, <hi>for I was hungry, &amp;c.</hi> hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who and what maner of

men they bee, for whom he prepared his Kingdom: and that is, they be ſuch, as have ſerved God by works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; duties of an holy life.</p>
                     <p>This point may further bee cleared by two reaſons or arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> Becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth not allot any place in heaven for wicked and ungodly men, but ſtill ſhutteth them out of the heavenly Jeruſalem.

And ſo of him that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his talents of grace to Gods glory, the ſentence was, <hi>Caſt yee the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſſe: there ſhall be weeping and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of teeth. Matt.</hi> 25.30. Where (1.) when hee ſaith, <hi>Caſt him into darkneſſe,</hi> that implieth, that the place of his abode, is a place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to heaven. For heaven is a place of light and glory. <hi>The glory of the Lord doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. Apoc.</hi> 21.23. And therefore the place of theſe mens abode being
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:2455:191"/>
a place of darkneſſe, much like to ſome deep dungeon, wherein a man can neither ſee hand nor foot, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that therefore the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are in a place, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to heaven, as darkneſſe is to light. (2.) When hee ſaith, Caſt him <hi>into outer darkneſſe,</hi> or darknes, which is without, that ſheweth that both the ſinner and the place of his abode is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And hence alſo it is, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of them that obey not the Goſpell, that they ſhall bee <hi>puniſhed with everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9.

Where, when hee ſaith, <hi>It is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> or a juſt thing with God; he implieth that God ſhould be unjuſt, if either he ſhould give heaven to them who have ſerved the divell, or denie it to them, that have ſerved God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot be unjuſt; therefore wicked men muſt be puniſhed; and becauſe there is no puniſhment in heaven, therefore wicked men muſt bee excluded thence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> A ſecond Proofe or argument, to ſhew that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2455:194"/>
the keeping of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements is a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required of them that ſhall be bleſſed, is, becauſe God hath aſſigned hell, as the proper habitation of all ungodly perſons. It is ſaid of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that when in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of mercie hee had hanged himſelfe, hee went [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, or, (as our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation hath well rendred the word) <hi>to his owne place.</hi> Where, there is no doubt, but hee meaneth hell, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iudas</hi> went for his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: and he calleth hell <hi>his owne</hi> or his proper place, (1.) becauſe he had deſerved and purchaſed it by his ſin. For as it is ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Hee purchaſed a field with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:2455:195"/>
of iniquity;</hi> ſo it is true, that he purchaſed hell with the practice of his iniquitie. (2.) It is called <hi>his own</hi> place, becauſe God had aſſigned and appointed that place to <hi>Iudas,</hi> and all ſuch, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, who ſell CHRIST ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for profit or pleaſure. And for this cauſe it is, that the Judge at the laſt day, will ſay to the wicked, <hi>Go ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Divell and his Angels.</hi> And if hell be the place deſerved by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and deſtinated to them by Almighty God; then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can be no place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch perſons in. And therefore if theſe men go out of the world without repentance, they go to hell
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2455:195"/>
without all redemption. And by this it appeareth, that the keeping of Gods word, is a neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, required to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of that perſon, that ſhall bee made partaker of bleſſednes &amp; an happie life. And this is the firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in reſpect whereof the keeping of Gods word is availeable to eternall life.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A ſecond is, that the keeping of Gods word is availeable to ſalvation, as a ſervice or worke, whoſe reward is bleſſedneſſe and eternall life.</p>
                     <p>For the clearing of this, I will ſet downe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concl. Bleſſedneſſe is the reward of well doing,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2455:196"/>
or (which is all one) of the keeping of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. This may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved firſt in generall, and then in particular.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In generall thus: <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether:</hi> And then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Moreover, by them is thy ſervant warned, and in keeping of them there is great reward. Pſ.</hi> 19.9, 11. And <hi>Pſ.</hi> 58.11. <hi>Verily</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>there is a reward for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: verily he is a God, that judgeth in the earth.</hi> And ſo our Lord ſaith of himſelfe, that when hee cometh to judge the world, he <hi>will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward every man according to his work. Matt.</hi> 16.27. And S. <hi>Paul, God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>will
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2455:196"/>
render to every man according to his deedes. To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeeke for glorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and immortality, eternall life; but unto them, that are contentious, and doe not obey the truth—indignation and wrath. Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8. Where (1.) when he ſaith, God will <hi>render—according to works;</hi> he ſheweth what the rule is, by which God will proceed in judging of the world, namely according to mens works. (2) When he ſaith, <hi>To them who by patient, &amp;c.</hi> he explaineth that rule by particular inſtances. He will render to men according to their workes; 1. to them which continue in well-doing, he will render eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2455:197"/>
life as their reward; and to them, that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and diſobedient, ſhall be indignation and wrath. By all which thus much is apparent, that in generall God rewardeth well-doing with bleſſednes and eternall life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now in the 2. place, let us conſider how God rewardeth particular and ſpeciall vertues; and wee ſhall finde, (1.) that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth <hi>Martyrdome</hi> and patience in ſuffering for CHRIST with bleſſednes and eternall life. So ſaith our Saviour; <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſake: for theirs is the Kingdome of heaven. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are yee, when men revile
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2455:197"/>
you and perſecute you, &amp;c. for great is your reward in heaven. Matt.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. (2.) Hee rewardeth <hi>mercifulneſſe</hi> to CHRISTS Diſciples or Confeſſors; <hi>He that giveth a cup of cold water onely to a Beleever, in the name of a diſciple, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward. Matt.</hi> 10.42. (3.) He rewardeth <hi>almſdeeds</hi> to the poore and needie. So our Saviour; <hi>When thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, the blinde: and thou ſhalt be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For thou ſhalt bee recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed at the reſurrection of the juſt. Luk.</hi> 14.13, 14. (4.) <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance</hi> in God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, hath a promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Caſt not away your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, which
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:2455:198"/>
hath great recompenſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Heb.</hi> 10.35. (5.) <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi> and obedience in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, toward their earthly maſters, hath a reward from God farre more then their ſervice is to men: <hi>Servants</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>obey in all things your Maſters—not with eye—ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart, fearing God. And whatſoever ye do</hi> (in your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to your maſters) <hi>do it heartily, as to the Lord and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord yee ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance. Col.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24. Thus the Scripture goeth before us in diverſe particular duties, ſhewing how God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; and by theſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2455:198"/>
giveth us example, how to judge of all the reſt. And from hence the concluſion is apparent and cleare, that both in generall and in each particular, heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pines is the reward of well-doing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Concl.</hi> This reward of bleſſedneſſe allotted to good works, is for the meaſure of it, ſquared &amp; proportioned according to the goodneſſe of the works. For though all good works are rewarded with bleſſedneſſe, Yet all are not rewarded in the like meaſure and degree. Thoſe good works, which excell other in goodneſſe ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed other in the greatneſſe of the reward. For <hi>every man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2455:199"/>
receive his owne reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne labour.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. Hee ſpeaketh there of ſome that <hi>planted,</hi> and ſome that <hi>watered,</hi> and of them he ſaith that every one ſhall receive his owne reward. Hee meaneth, hee that planteth, ſhall receive the reward of a <hi>planter,</hi> and he that watereth, ſhall have the reward of a <hi>waterer.</hi> To the like purpoſe our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that receiveth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the name of a prophet, ſhall receive a prophets reward: and, he that receiveth a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man in the name of a righteous man, ſhall receive a righteous mans reward. Matt.</hi> 10.41. By which ſpeeches, this is implied, that there is one kinde of reward belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:2455:199"/>
to a prophet doing his dutie in his place, and an other belonging to a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, as hee is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And hereto agreeth that of the prophet; <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine, as the firmament, and they that turn many to righteouſneſſe, as the ſtarres for ever and ever. Dan.</hi> 12.3. The concluſion is cleare, the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of the reward is ſquared accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of the work.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Concl.</hi> This reward of well-doing is due to it, not for the worthineſſe of the work, but by vertue of Gods promiſe.</p>
                     <p>By vertue of Gods <hi>promiſe</hi> I grant it to be due. For God hath promiſed heaven to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2455:200"/>
good works, as hath beene ſhewed already: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is due debt, as wee uſe to ſpeake, and all men do acknowledge. Even a mans word tieth him to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, &amp; Gods word muſt needes tie him much more. From hence it is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of the crown of glorie laied up in heaven for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſerve God aright; ſtileth God by the name of a <hi>righteous or juſt judge</hi> in beſtowing of that reward, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. And in an other place, <hi>God</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love. Heb.</hi> 6.10. Where (1.) when hee ſaith that God <hi>doth not forget</hi> their good works, hee meaneth that he leaveth them not
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2455:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unrewarded. And (2.) when he ſaith, that <hi>God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt</hi> to forget them; he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that God ſhould bee unjuſt, if he did not reward their labour in his ſervice. But he ſpeaketh more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſame purpoſe,<note place="margin">

                        </note> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>It is a juſt thing with God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to recompenſe tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you, which are troubled, reſt with us.</hi> Where wee may note, that it is a point of juſtice in God, as well to reward the patient ſuffering of Martyrs and Confeſſors, as the wrong oppreſſures of perſecutors and evill doers. Be it granted then, that a reward is due to well-doing, by vertue of Gods promiſe, who for our
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2455:201"/>
encouragement hath tied himſelfe by this bond. But yet notwithſtanding, there is no <hi>merit</hi> or worth in our beſt works, by which wee may laie claime to ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This is cleare by the words of a S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaking of Martyrdome and patience in perſecution for CHRISTS ſake, which is one of the moſt glorious works, to which CHRIST hath promiſed his reward; yet even of this hee ſaith, <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee compared with the glory that ſhall be reveiled. Ro.</hi> 8.18. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>worketh for us a more excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eternall weight of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2455:201"/>
glory.</hi> Where by elevating our ſervice in ſuffering for CHRIST, and amplifying the reward, that is given unto us for it; he plainely ſheweth that there is no equality or proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the work and the reward, Our Saviour alſo, <hi>when we have done all things that are commanded us,</hi> (And yet who is there that doth ſo? but upon ſuppoſition that we have done all,) yet he teacheth us to ſay unto God, <hi>Wee are unprofitable ſervants: wee doe that which is our duty to doe. Luk.</hi> 17.10. Hee meaneth, that becauſe it is no more, then our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth binde us to, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot plead merit or deſert; God oweth us
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2455:202"/>
no thanks for it, no more then a maſter oweth thanks to his ſervant, when he hath done, what he is bound by his place to do.</p>
                     <p>I conclude then that the reward of bleſſedneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to well-doing, is due by Gods promiſe, and not for the worth of any works.</p>
                     <p>And now out of all theſe things laied together, the concluſion followeth, which I propounded in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the keeping of Gods word is availeable to happineſſe, as a ſervice, to which eternall life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for a reward. And hence we have theſe dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for our further uſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Seeing holineſſe is a neceſſary condition required
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2455:202"/>
unto bleſſedneſſe; this may be for an Admonition to all evill doers, who live in any ſin againſt conſcience. They may hence take notice how fearfull their ſtate is for the preſent, and how needfull it will be for them to begin a better life. For I ſuppoſe, there is no man living ſo deſperatly madd, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth that he may be happy: nor is there any man among Chriſtians, but knoweth that happineſſe is no where to be had, but with God in heaven: and now it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the declaration of this point, that no evill doers, ſhall ever enter into that place. Take a view, if ye pleaſe, of all the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men in the world; and ye

There is a manſion for the penitent thiefe: <hi>this day</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſhalt thou bee with mee in Paradiſe. Luk.</hi> 23.43. And, in a word, there is a manſion for every righteous man: they <hi>ſhall ſhine forth, as the ſun, in the Kingdome of their father. Matt.</hi> 13.43.

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:2455:209"/>
come, the cropp will make a recompenſe for all, and we ſhall receive our ſeede with advantage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Med.</hi> Among men, they are counted rich men, that have good ſtore of ground for their tillage; &amp; every man is glad, if he can purchaſe land, where hee may ſow in the ſpring, and then reape the cropp at the harveſt. And ſo every one among us, that deſireth to be rich towards God, ſhould bee glad, when hee hath ground to ſow his ſeede of righteouſneſſe in; that his cropp may be the greater at the harveſt. For example, if we ſee a poore ſervant of CHRIST in want and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, there is a piece of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:2455:210"/>
ground to ſow our ſeedes of charity in. If we relieve him, wee ſhall enrich our ſelves by it. And, if we ſee a poore man oppreſſed by a potent neighbour; here is ground to ſow our ſeede of juſtice in. If we can and do help him to his right, wee ſhall gaine helpe at Gods hands, an hundred fold more. And if wee meete with a man that is ſad and perplexed in minde; here is ground to ſow our ſeede of compaſſion and comfort in. And if wee help to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſtrengthen him in his grief; God will comfort our ſoules againſt all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and feare. The ſumme is, a man cannot bee a loſer by doing of good
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2455:210"/>
deedes, no more then the huſbandman is a loſer by ſowing of his ſeede. I pray, as our Church doth; <hi>Stirre up, O Lord, the wills of thy faithfull people, that they plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly bringing forth the fruit of good works, may of thee bee plenteouſly rewarded, through</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>our</hi> LORD.</p>

concurre to the procuring of our happineſſe. To which purpoſe that I may ſpeake the more plainely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly; I will ſet downe that which I have to ſay, in three ſeverall concluſions. And they be theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>Concl.</hi> Hearing of Gods word, whether read or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, is ſo farre forth onely uſefull for a Chriſtians bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, as it directeth and furthereth him to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Gods word, and the doing of his will contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it.</p>
                     <p>For proofe hereof there be theſe arguments or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> Hearing of Gods word is therefore availeable to bleſſedneſſe, becauſe by
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2455:213"/>
it we learne the way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and are by it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to walk and go on in that way. This to be the uſe of Gods word heard and read, I have proved already: and other uſe then this the Scripture reveileth none, nor can any man with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon imagin any other. I now add hereto as an Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that propoſition, But the way to bleſſedneſſe is by the obedience of Gods Law, and the keeping of his word. This is proved by thoſe Scriptures, which call Gods commandements, his waies; by which he leadeth men to heaven and happineſſe; and our keeping or obſerving of thoſe commandements, a walking in that way. In this
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2455:213"/>
kinde <hi>David</hi> deſcribing the happy eſtate of a righteous man, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his teſtimonies: they alſo do no iniquity, but walke in his wayes. Pſ.</hi> 119.2, 3. But <hi>Solomon</hi> more directly to this purpoſe, <hi>Hee is in the way of life, that keepeth inſtruction. Pro.</hi> 10.17. Where (1.) when he ſaith, <hi>Hee that keepeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> he meaneth ſuch a one, as ſubmitteth himſelfe to be guided by Gods word, and doth that which God teacheth him therein. And (2.) when he ſaith of ſuch a man, that he is <hi>in the way of life,</hi> he meaneth he is going on in the right way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life and happineſſe. And to like purpoſe <hi>David</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Teach mee the way of
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2455:214"/>
thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keepe it unto the end. Pſ.</hi> 119.33. and ſo he promiſeth, <hi>I will run the way of thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart. v.</hi> 32. In all which, and many other ſayings to like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, wee have two things worth our obſervation: (1.) that the keeping of Gods word, is a walking in Gods way, and (2.) that this way of God, in which we are to walk, is alſo the way of life and happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>And from hence, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is cleare; If hearing do therefore profit us to eternall life, becauſe by it wee learne the right way, that leadeth thereunto; and this way bee nothing elſe, but the keeping of Gods
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2455:214"/>
word: then hearing is only ſo farre availeable to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, as it furthereth us to a godly life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> In Scriptures Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded unto us, as the <hi>means</hi> that bringeth us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the doing of Gods word is ſet out, as the end, for which Hearing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. This, (to go no further) is ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of one booke of the Law, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> I meane, in which the pen-man of the word, doth moſt clearly and punctually deſcribe the uſe of Gods Law. In that booke chap. 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh to the people, <hi>Hearken, O Iſrael, unto the ſtatuts and judgements, which
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2455:215"/>
I teach you, for to do them:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I have taught you ſtatuts and judgements, that ye ſhould do ſo:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, ſaith of his people; <hi>I will make them to heare my words, that they may leàrne to feare me;</hi> that is, to ſerve and obey me. Againe, chap. 5.1. <hi>Heare ô Iſrael</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) the ſtatuts and judgements, which I ſpeake in your eares this day; that ye may learne them and know them and do them.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 31. God himſelfe ſpeaketh, <hi>I will ſpeake</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all the commandements and ſtatuts and judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which thou ſhalt teach them, that they may doe them.</hi> The like ſpeechs are found <hi>Deuter.</hi> 6.1, 2. and 31.12. and elſwhere: but where
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2455:215"/>
the caſe is clear, it is needles to heape up proofs. Thus much is plaine from hence, that Hearing is the meanes, and Doing is the end, for which Hearing ſerveth.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning things, the one whereof is the <hi>meanes,</hi> and the other the <hi>end,</hi> the Learned give us this rule <hi>[finis dat mediis men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuram,] the end preſcribeth unto the meanes their quantity and meaſure,</hi> namely how much, and how far &amp; how often they may be uſed; and that is, ſo, as is requiſit for attaining of the end. Others deliver the rule thus, <hi>[Media accipiunt amabilitatem, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; menſuram à finc,]</hi> the <hi>deſire and order and meaſure of the meanes are to be eſteemed
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2455:216"/>
and muſt bee regulated by the end,</hi> for which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and for which they do ſerve: ſo that they are to be uſed neither more nor leſſe, but ſo as they may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that end. For better explaining of this, take theſe examples. <hi>Health</hi> is the end, which both the Phyſician and the patient do aime at, and <hi>Phyſick</hi> is the meanes either to recover or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and therefore Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is onely ſo farre forth good, and to be uſed in that maner and meaſure as may further the patients health. Againe, <hi>meat</hi> and drink and exerciſe are the meanes; <hi>ſtrength</hi> and life and vigour are the end for which theſe meanes were ordained. And
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2455:216"/>
therefore meat and drink and exerciſe are onely ſo far forth deſireable, as they are effectuall to preſerve life and ſtrength. And juſt ſo it is in the caſe now propounded. Hearing &amp; learning of Gods word are the meanes; doing &amp; performing of that word is the end for which Hearing is intended. It followeth, Therefore hearing is only ſo farre forth good, as it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth a godly life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> Hearing and learning are exerciſes onely fit for a ſtate of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where men have neede of theſe helps, to bring them unto, and keepe them in obedience of Gods Laws. And for this cauſe, while we remaine in this mortall life,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:2455:217"/>
where ſuch is our ignorance, that without inſtructions from Gods word wee know not how to ſerve him aright; and ſuch is our backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to good things, that unleſſe wee be eftſoones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and urged to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our duty out of the grounds of Gods word, we would go in a blindefold ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie to hell and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in this life, I ſay, and while we are ſubject to theſe defects &amp; weakneſſes, there is neceſſary uſe of hearing and reading and learning. But in heaven, where is no ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, nor no backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor no ſuch defects &amp; infirmities; there hearing and all helps of perſwaſion are of no uſe. To this purpoſe
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:2455:217"/>
the Apoſtle telleth us, that <hi>Prophecies ſhall failc,</hi> and the gift of <hi>tongues ſhall ceaſe, and knowledge,</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium docendi munus Beza.</note> that is, Arts &amp; ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces ſerving for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) <hi>ſhall vaniſh away.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. And he giveth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it in the next words: for (ſaith he) <hi>we know in part, and we prophecie in part, but when that which is perfect, is come; then that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, ſhall bee done away.</hi> He meaneth that theſe helps were ordained for a ſtate of imperfection, in which wee have neede of teaching and exhorting, to ſupplie our defects: but when wee ſhall bee perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſhall be ready to ſerve God without let, then all theſe meanes of teaching
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:2455:218"/>
and learning ſhall bee done away. Whence I inferre, that as the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, do not heare Sermons, nor read Scriptures, nor uſe any other helps of learning or inſtruction; ſo, in the life to come, when we alſo ſhall be like the Angels in heaven, we ſhall neither heare, nor reade, nor learne any more. And becauſe hearing onely ſerveth, to inſtruct us while we know not how to ſerve God aright, &amp; to perſwade us to ſerve God, while wee may be drawen away from his ſervice: therefore, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods word, profiteth us only ſo farre, as it ſerveth to make us better; which is that, which I ſaid in my firſt concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="393" facs="tcp:2455:218"/>II. <hi>Concl.</hi> Hearing of Gods word, if it bee ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from doing, is rejected in Scriptures, as a thing of no worth. This is proved,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Every one that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them not, ſhall be likened to a fooliſh man, which built his houſe upon the ſand:</hi> or (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it) He is <hi>like a man, that without a foundation built an houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth: againſt which the ſtreame did beate vehemently, &amp; immediately it fell, and the ruine was great. Luk.</hi> 6.49.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By that reproofe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Prophet, where it is ſaid of the Jews, to their reproch, <hi>They heare thy words, but they do them not.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2455:219"/>
Ezek.</hi> 33.32. Where expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee onely telleth what they did do, but impliedly blameth &amp; reproveth them for ſo doing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By that exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only deceiving your owne ſelves. Iam.</hi> 1.22. In which words the Apoſtle firſt giveth us a rule concerning Gods word, and that is expreſſed both affirmatively, <hi>Be yee doers;</hi> and negatively, not <hi>Hearers onely.</hi> And ſecondly of this rule hee giveth us a reaſon, becauſe, if a man heare, &amp; do not do, he <hi>deceiveth himſelfe.</hi> The meaning is, he thinketh he ſerveth God, by hearing of his word, &amp; that thereby hee may further his owne
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:2455:219"/>
ſalvation: but he that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo, deceiveth his owne ſoule, and will miſſe of his expectation. The concluſion hence is, Hearing without doing is a labour in vaine, &amp; the practice of a fooliſh man; and conſequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God, as a thing of no worth.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Concl.</hi> Hearing of Gods word, without practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing what we learne by it; doth hurt the ſoule, by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating of the ſinne. This is proved.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the rule of our Saviour; <hi>The ſervant, that knew his Lords will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not himſelfe, neither did according to his will, ſhall bee beaten with many ſtripes, &amp;c. for to whomſoever much is
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:2455:220"/>
given, of him ſhall bee much required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. Luk.</hi> 12.47, 48. Conſider here (1.) a doctrine, <hi>The ſervant that knew his Lords will, &amp;c.</hi> and (2.) the proofe of it, <hi>for to whomſoever much is given, &amp;c.</hi> And from both theſe the concluſion is, that where God giveth a man more meanes and better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of learning and knowing Gods will, there he requireth the more duty; and will inflict the greater judgement, if it bee negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From thoſe judgments, which GOD denounceth againſt them, which do not profit by his word, &amp; other
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2455:220"/>
meanes of grace. Such as theſe are, <hi>He that rejecteth me, &amp; receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him at the laſt day. Ioh.</hi> 12.48. And, <hi>this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darknes rather then light. Ioh.</hi> 3.16. And, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them; they had not had ſinne: but now have they no cloke for their ſinne. Ioh.</hi> 15.22. But it is a cutting ſentence to this purpoſe, which wee reade <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.7. <hi>The earth, which drinketh-in the raine, that cometh oft upon it, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth herbs meete for them, by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſsing from God. But that,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:2455:221"/>
which beareth thornes and briers, is rejected and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to bee burned.</hi> The ſentence is allegoricall; the plaine ſenſe is, that the men, upon whom GOD beſtoweth much meanes of grace; if they be not fruitfull in good works, are lyable to the greater curſe, by how much they have had the better meanes. The like is intended alſo by that parable of the vineyard, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 5.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme that riſeth out of all this, is, that the more meanes we have, the more duty we owe, and the more puniſhment wee ſhall ſuffer if wee neglect that duty. Whence againe it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that Hearing and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2455:221"/>
learning of Gods word, if they do not further our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they increaſe our judgement. It followeth from hence alſo, that all the goodneſſe, which is in Hearing, is <hi>relative</hi> only; ſo farre forth as it furthereth our obedience and our kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Gods word.</p>
                     <p>But now on the contrary, the doing of Gods will, is good in and of it ſelfe: it both pleaſeth GOD, and maketh us an immediat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Kingdome of heaven. So S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they, that do his commandements, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the City. Apoc.</hi> 22.14. And S. <hi>Peter, If yee
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2455:222"/>
do theſe things,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye ſhall never fall: for ſo an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhall bee miniſtred unto you abundantly into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom of our Lord &amp; Saviour</hi> JESUS CHRIST. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11.</p>
                     <p>Theſe be the three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, which ſerve for the explaining of the point. Lay them together, and ye have a full anſwere to the queſtion. The queſtion is, how and with what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Hearing &amp; keeping of Gods word, do concurre to the procuring of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe and happy being: and the anſwer ariſing from the premiſſes is, that they do concurre as joint cauſes or helps to happineſſe, but in a much different maner.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:2455:222"/>
They be not <hi>[cauſae coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natae,] cauſes of equall</hi> and even reſpect, like two oxen that draw in the ſame yoke, or like two men that carie one burden betweene them. But they bee <hi>[cauſae ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natae] cauſes</hi> whereof one is <hi>ſubordinat</hi> and ſerviceable to the other; like the needle and the threed, both which concurre to the ſewing of a garment together; but the needle maketh the entrance, and the threed knitteth and conjoyneth the parts in one. Or, they be like the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and the medicine; both which are joint meanes for recoverie of health: but the preparative maketh way for the medicine, and the medicine it worketh
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2455:223"/>
the cure. The ſubſtance of my ſpeech is this; Hearing and Doing concurre, as joint helps of happineſſe: but hearing maketh way for doing, and doing maketh entrance into glory.</p>
                     <p>And thus much may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the explication and proofe of the point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. The uſes are:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Seeing hearing is of no uſe further then it helpeth us to the doing of Gods will; by this we may ſee the great follie of thoſe men, who think highly of themſelves, and preferre their owne zele before their neighbours, becauſe they are frequent hearers, and ſkilfull talkers of Scriptures and religion, though in the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2455:223"/>
meane while their practice be not anſwerable. And ſuch there have beene in all ages, and ſuch there are too many in our age alſo. This is made good by ſome examples out of Scripture, &amp; by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our own times.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Ex.</hi> The firſt is that which we finde <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.30, 31, 32. <hi>They ſpeake one to an other, every man to his brother, ſaying, Come I pray you, and heare what is the word that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth from the Lord. And they come unto thee</hi> (ſaith God to the Prophet) <hi>as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee, as my people, and they heare thy words, but they will not do them. For with their mouth the ſhew much love: but their heart goeth after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:2455:224"/>
And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtrument. For they heare thy words, but they do them not.</hi> Note here (1.) their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe in hearing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared three wayes. 1. They invite and exhort ech other to goe and heare the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, when hee preached Gods word; <hi>Come,</hi> ſay, they, <hi>and heare, what is the word, &amp;c.</hi> juſt as if men ſhould now ſay one to an other, Come and let us go to ſuch a Lecture, or let us go and heare ſuch a Sermon. 2. they flock to the Prophet in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. <hi>They come,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>as the people cometh;</hi> that is, not dropping in,

one by one, but they throng-in by troupes. 3. They liſten to that which is delivered. <hi>They ſit</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>as my people:</hi> that is, devoutly and attentively, waiting what God will ſay unto them. And thus farre all is well, if it were as ſincere in deede, as in ſhew it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee. This was the forwardneſſe of this people. (2.) Note their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to do what they were taught. <hi>They heare thy words, but do them not:</hi> and <hi>with their mouths they ſhew much love; but their heart goeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their covetouſneſſe.</hi> 3. Note Gods cenſure of this dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; <hi>Thou art to them as a lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:2455:225"/>
well upon an inſtrument.</hi> Hee meaneth, that they made the like uſe of the Prophet, that a man would do of a minſtrell, and they heard his ſermons, as a man would heare a plaie. Thus the Lord cenſured thoſe hot profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors among the Jews: and the like cenſure agreeth well to the <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>talking</hi> hearers, of our dayes. They, that frequent Lectures, and flock after ſermons, and gape after the preachers words; and yet, when they are gone home, are as ready to ſlander their neighbours, and as forward to ſpeake evill of Government, and as watchfull to deceive Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, &amp;c. as ever they were before: theſe bee the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:2455:225"/>
hypocriticall Hearers, that <hi>Ezekiell</hi> ſpeaketh of, who ſhew much love with their mouths, but their hearts go after their unlawfull luſts; and theſe be the deceitfull hearers, of whom S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that they deceive themſelves. And of theſe I may ſay, They make no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of a preacher, then a man would do of a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrell: that is, to delight themſelves with his voice, but not to follow his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Ex.</hi> The ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that fitteth this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is that in <hi>Ezekiell</hi> chap. 14. ſet downe at large in many verſes together: but ſummarily compriſed in the 7, and 8. verſes. The words
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:2455:226"/>
are; <hi>Every one—which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth himſelfe from me, and ſetteth up his idol in his heart, and putteth the ſtumbling block of his iniquitie before his face, and cometh to a Prophet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him concerning mee; I the Lord will anſwere him by my ſelfe. And I will ſet my face againſt that man, and will make him a ſigne &amp; a proverb. &amp;c.</hi> In this paſſage there are two things conſiderable: (1.) A caſe propounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the people. And (2) the anſwer that God maketh unto it. The caſe is this; It is ſuppoſed, that a man doth not only repaire to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Sermons in publick, but beſides goeth to him in privat, and aſketh his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in points of religion
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2455:226"/>
and Gods ſervice: and yet this man ſetteth up an idol in his heart, and a ſtumbling block before his face: that is, he hath ſome one thing or other that he maketh his idol, loving and adoring it, &amp; looking towards it, as the deſire of his eyes, more then he loveth or adoreth the true God, whoſe word he cometh to enquire after. This is the caſe. Now the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that God giveth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is, <hi>I will anſwere him by my ſelfe, I will ſet my face againſt him, &amp;c.</hi> Applie wee this to our times, &amp; it is thus much in effect. They, that pretend to be more zelous &amp; religious then other men be; theſe do not only come to heare our ſermons in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2455:227"/>
but they deſire alſo to have our counſell in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, and propound caſes of conſcience, deſiring our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection therein. And it is a commendable courſe, and a ready way to gaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding by. But if ſuch a man, thus zelous in his way, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſet up an idol in his heart; that is, if he have a purpoſe, or do live in any knowen ſinne againſt his conſcience. God will meete with that man in his anger, and cut him off with the wicked, that never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Ex.</hi> A third example may be that ſpoken of by our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26. <hi>They ſhall ſay unto me,</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2455:227"/>
our Lord) <hi>we have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets. But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not, whence ye are, depart from me all ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> And (as it is <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.22.) <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day</hi> (of the great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not prophecied in thy name? and in thy name have caſt out divels? and in thy name have done many wonderfull works? And then I will profeſſe unto them, I never knew you: depart from mee, ye that work iniquity.</hi> Here I conſider two things. (1) What theſe great pretenders to religion did alledge for themſelves, and that was, that they had heard CHRIST himſelfe
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2455:228"/>
preaching unto them in his own perſon; yea that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did preach in his name, and (which is yet more) in his name had caſt out divels. And hereupon they thought that they had a ſpeciall intereſt in Chriſt and his Kingdome. (2.) I conſider what our LORD anſwered to theſe allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; hee denieth not, but that it was true, that they had heard CHRIST prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching among them, and that they had taught and done miracles in his name: all this he grants to be true. But he denieth, that for any or all of theſe, they had any right in him or in his Kingdome; <hi>I never knew you; depart from me.</hi> And why? why, even
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:2455:228"/>
becauſe <hi>ye are workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> The application here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is obvious and eaſy. If men be workers of iniquity, that is, if they live in any knowen ſinne which they will not preſently forſake; no hearing of Gods word, though CHRIST himſelfe were the preacher; nor no preaching of Gods word, though themſelves were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with that holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; no, nor no caſting out of divels, as ſome even in our daies have pretended to do: neither any, nor all of theſe things, can gaine them a title to heaven, or a right to bleſſedneſſe &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. Let every good Chriſtian then take heede, that himſelfe be not caried
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:2455:229"/>
away, with errour of the wicked; who think highly of themſelves for their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sermons, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scriptures, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of religion. Theſe are good, if they be well uſed, that is, if they be made to ſerve as meanes of pietie and a godly life: if they make us more juſt, &amp; more ſober, and more peaceable, and more charitable, and more conſcionable in all our wayes and dealings; then they are the bleſſings of God, and prepare men by holineſſe to a bleſſed life. But if they bee ſeparated from ſanctitie and a godly life; then the curſe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, <hi>Depart from mee ye workers of iniquity;</hi> and,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2455:229"/>
                        <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the divell and his Angels:</hi> from which God will deliver all them, that feare and ſerve him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Seeing Hearing is of no further uſe, then as it fitteth us for doing; hence we have a good rule to judge of the goodneſſe of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by. For if hearing be no more worth then as it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth us to doing: then preaching is of as litle worth, if it bee not fitted for the ſame end. The reaſon is, becauſe preaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, are both of them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the ſame end: nor would there be any uſe of preaching if there were no neede of hearing. No man ever preached to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2455:230"/>
becauſe he wanteth wit to learn what is taught; nor will any man ever preach to the glorified ſoules, that bee in heaven, becauſe they have no neede of teaching. Preaching onely is for this purpoſe, that men, who haue neede of inſtruction, may learne and make uſe of what is taught. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if that hearing bee vaine, which doth not further a godly life, then that preaching is no better then babling, which is not fit to beget godlineſſe and vertue. And this note yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us two practicall rules; one for the Preacher, and an other for the Hearers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Rule.</hi> The rule for the Preacher is this, that in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:2455:230"/>
and compoſing of his Sermon, he ſhould aime at the peoples profiting in an holy life: &amp; all his thoughts and words ſhould be ſuch, as may worke men to the obedience of Gods Law.</p>
                     <p>For confirmation hereof wee have Gods owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.17. <hi>I am the</hi> LORD <hi>thy God,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>which teacheth thee to profit, and leadeth thee by the way, that thou ſhouldeſt goe.</hi> I note two things. (1.) When hee ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord, which teacheth thee,</hi> hee profeſſeth himſelfe to bee a preacher, whoſe office is to teach men the way of eternall life. And (2.) when he ſaith, I am the Lord which <hi>teacheth to profit:</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> that is, as
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2455:231"/>
                        <hi>Montanus</hi> rendereth it, <hi>[ad proficiendum,]</hi> ſo <hi>as thou majeſt profit by it,</hi> or, as the vulgar readeth it more plainely, though not ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, <hi>[docens te utilia]</hi> which <hi>teacheth thee profitable things;</hi> or, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſeth it, <hi>[apta ad prodeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendum,] ſuch things as are apt or fit to profit them,</hi> in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And this, as a<note n="*" place="margin">Corn. à Lapides.</note> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writer enlargeth the ſenſe is, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>[non curioſa, non vana, non pompoſa, &amp; plauſum cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantia.]</hi> I teach thee, <hi>not curioſities, not vanities, not floriſhes, and ſuch things as may gain praiſes and applauſe: but I teach thee,</hi> (ſaith the Lord Almighty) <hi>ſuch things, as may bee for thy ſafety here,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2455:231"/>
and thy ſalvation hereafter.</hi> Thus the wiſe Lord, the great Paſtor and ſhepheard of our ſoules, hath left us an example, that we who are Paſtors in his Church, ſhould follow his ſteps. And in theſe ſteps did the bleſſed Apoſtle tread, who in diſcharge of his duty, could ſay to his Scholars, <hi>I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you. Act.</hi> 20.20. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſell of God.</hi> In w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſentences put together, it is worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that firſt he ſaith, <hi>he kept back nothing that was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp; then, ſaying the ſame thing over again, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto them, <hi>all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God.</hi> And hence the collection is eaſie, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2455:232"/>
the whole counſell of God, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to be declared &amp; preached unto the people, is onely of ſuch things, as are profitable to happineſſe and a bleſſed life. And now, if any deſire to know what theſe profitable things were, which he uſed to preach to Gods people; himſelfe hath tould us elſwhere, that the ſumme of his Sermons was, that men ſhould <hi>repent, and turne to God, and do works meete for repentance. Act.</hi> 26.20. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ungodlines, and worldly luſts, they ſhould live ſoberly and righteouſly and godlily in this preſent world:</hi> Soberly, by moderation in the uſe of temporall comforts; and righteouſly, by juſt and faire
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:2455:232"/>
dealing among men; and godlily, by ſerving God in the holy duties of religion. Theſe were the profitable things which God taught the people of Iſrael, and the Apoſtle preached in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
                     <p>And we that be the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Gods word, and diſpenſers of his myſteries, ought both to imitate <hi>God as dear children, Epheſ.</hi> 5.1. and to be <hi>followers of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, as hee is of</hi> CHRIST. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, as God himſelfe taught his people profitable things; and as S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught his Auditors, to repent and turne unto God, and do works meet for repentance, and that they ſhould live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:2455:233"/>
and righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent world: So our Sermons, both for the matter and the maner of them, ſhould be ſuch as that the Hearers may profit in piety and a godly life, and by ſerving God in holineſſe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, may be brought to heaven &amp; eternall glory. And therefore, when wee are at our Studies, framing our Sermons in privat, and when we are about to utter them in publik; wee ſhould reflect our thoughts upon every part or paſſage of our meditations, queſtioning with our hearts (God and our owne conſciences being the Judges of our thoughts;) whether ſuch a point in the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:2455:233"/>
Sermon, or ſuch a ſentence in our diſcourſe, be apt to miniſter grace to the hearts of the hearers; and ſuch as may further them in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a good life, and in one kinde or other help forward their ſalvation and happineſſe. And if we finde any thing more then this, or otherwiſe then thus, wee may and ought to blot out that, and caſt it away as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either pernicious, or at the beſt, but ſuperfluous and idle. This courſe, if wee hold both in penning of our Sermons and in delivering of them; we ſhall approve our ſelves as <hi>good Miniſters of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, and may in ſo doing both ſave our ſelves, and them
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:2455:234"/>
that heare us. God direct both our hearts, &amp; tongues, ſo to preach CHRIST, that we prove our ſelves to bee the <hi>ſervants</hi> of our people <hi>for</hi> JESUS <hi>ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> The ſecond rule is for the Hearers: and that is, that becauſe a Sermon is no more worth then ſo farre as it furthereth men to an holy life; therefore they ſhould deſire to heare ſuch Sermons, and ever judge them beſt, by which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be made better. This rule is to be the more regarded, becauſe in all ages it hath beene ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. For firſt looke into the olde Teſtament, and conſider the times before our Lords Incarnation; and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:2455:234"/>
there ye ſhall finde that the people of thoſe times were <hi>rebellious, lying children,</hi> that <hi>would not heare the Law of the Lord. They ſaid to the Seers, See not; and to the Prophets, Prophecie not unto us right things. Speake unto us ſmooth things, Prophecie deceits. Iſ.</hi> 30.10. And <hi>if a man walking in the ſpirit, and falſehood, do lie, ſaying, I will prophecie unto thee of wine &amp; of ſtrong drink, hee ſhall even bee the Prophet of this people.</hi> So ſaith the Prophet <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.11. and he meaneth, that if a man ſhould pretend to be ſent of God, and take upon him the office of a preacher; and ſhould withall preach libertie for their luſts, and a freedome to follow their
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:2455:235"/>
owne wills: this would be the onely man in their eſteeme and reckoning They would praiſe him and paie him, and follow him from towne to towne, and from one pariſh to an other. Againe, looke into the new Teſtament; and there yee ſhall heare our Lord telling the men of his time; <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if an other ſhall come in his own name, him ye will receive. Ioh.</hi> 5.43. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that men would not <hi>endure ſound doctrine, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own luſts would heap to themſelves teachers, having itching eares; and would turn away their ears from the truth, &amp; would be turned unto fables.</hi>
                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:2455:235"/>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. Where (1.) when he ſaith, <hi>Having itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eares;</hi> he meaneth, that they delight to have their eares tickled with ſuch ſpeeches, as may pleaſe the fanſie: as on the contratie the Poet ſaith of unpleaſing ſpeeches,<note place="margin">Quid opus eſt teneras mordaci radere vero Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las?</note> that they <hi>bite</hi> and grate the <hi>eares of</hi> men. (2.) When hee ſaith, that they deſire, <hi>Teachers after their owne luſts,</hi> he meaneth they deſire ſuch, as will preach what they pleaſe, and will ſay that is truth, which themſelves fanſie to be ſo, or at leaſt, which they wiſh were ſo. (3.) When he ſaith of theſe men, that they <hi>heape ſuch Teachers;</hi> he intimateth that they are not contented with one or two, ſuch as
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:2455:236"/>
God and the Church hath appointed to bee their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, but they runne from place to place, and ſingle out ſuch men for their maſters, as is agreable to their owne humors. This the Apoſtle did fortell of the later times: and into theſe times are we now fallen.</p>
                     <p>For firſt ſame there bee, who delight in fine phraſes, and wittie turnings: and if they heare ſuch a one, they entertaine him with Hems of applauſe. But when <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> made ſuch a like wordie ſpeech,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch. Apoph.</note> to the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>Phocion</hi> ſaid his words were like the <hi>Cypreſſe tree,</hi> which is <hi>goodly and faire</hi> to ſee to, <hi>but beareth no fruit.</hi> And ſo, I think, the men
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:2455:236"/>
who moſt admire ſuch flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of witt, can hardly ſay what fruit of godlines they finde in them. Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in men, that do glance at autoritie, and in a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting kinde of language, which their followers know whereto it tendeth, do nible at the orders of our Church, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent State. Such a man, if he bee once heard ſpeake in a pulpit, is followed all the town over. Nor is it any marvell: for it hath beene found true in all ages, that nothing is more pleaſing to the multitude, then to heare themſelves flattered, &amp; their ſuperiours traduced and ſlandered. See an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> &amp; the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:2455:237"/>
people of that time. <hi>Abſalom</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>roſe up earely, and ſtood by the ſide of the gate. And it was ſo, that when any man, that had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, came to the King for judgment; then Abſalom called unto him and ſaid—See, thy matters are good and right, but there is no man deputed of the King to heare thee, Abſalom ſaid moreover. Oh that I were made a Iudge in the land, that every man, that hath any ſuite or cauſe, might come to mee and I would do him juſtice, &amp;c. So Abſalom ſtole the hearts of the men of Iſrael.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15:2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In this Scripture wee may note two things, (1.) the practice that <hi>Abſalom</hi> uſed: and (2.) the ſucceſſe that it found. His practice
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:2455:237"/>
was in three things. 1. Hee flattered the Commons, <hi>See, thy matters are right,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 5. he <hi>gave them his hand.</hi> 2. Hee accuſed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>There is no man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>deputed of the King to heare thee;</hi> Hee meaneth there was no man, to decide his cauſe and to do him juſtice: He did not, nor could not for ſhame ſay, that the King did them any injuſtice; but by accuſing his officers, and complaining of thoſe that were about him, he brought the Kings Government into diſlike with the people. 3. Hee wiſhed for better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and Judges, that would right the poore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; <hi>Oh that I were made
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:2455:238"/>
Iudge in the land, that men might come to me, and I would do them juſtice.</hi> Such like was the practice of <hi>Abſalom.</hi> (2.) But how ſucceeded it? why, <hi>he ſtole away the hearts of the people, made</hi> them ill affected to the State, and the <hi>conſpiracie was ſtrong: for the people increaſed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with Abſalom,</hi> as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Thus it was in times paſt: we cannot expect any other thing in our dayes, but that if men of place, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if preachers ſhall ſhew themſelves popular, humoring the people and ſlandering the State, this will bee a pleaſing way to the multitude: and if a King were as good as <hi>David,</hi> and Biſhops as good as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:2455:238"/>
this courſe would ſteale away the hearts of the people, from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of King and State. And it is the great iniquitie of the common ſort, that they delight in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Teachers. Such men are here to be admoniſhed, that when they come from ſuch Sermons, they think with themſelves, how they have thereby profited in grace and goodneſſe; what good duty they have learned to performe, what ſin they have learned to ſubdue, or what rule they have learned to better their lifes by. I onely add this more, that if they or if any man be not edified by our Sermons, and made more holy and more
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:2455:239"/>
juſt and more ſober; then is our preaching in vaine, and their hearing is in vaine, &amp; in vaine it is to them, that God reveiled his will to the world: and better it were that Preachers were dumb, and people were deafe, then that they ſhould abuſe Gods word, in ſuch a vaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Seeing hearing, and learning, and knowing of Gods word, is only ſo farre good, as it helpeth us to do what God doth command; but Doing of Gods word is acceptable in it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe profitable, as an immediat condition, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Gods Kingdom: hence wee learne, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the keeping of Gods
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:2455:239"/>
word and commandements is. The young man in the Goſpell aſked of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Good maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may have eternall life?</hi> and our Lord anſwered him, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commandements. Matt.</hi> 19.16, 17. <hi>David</hi> asked of God, <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle, &amp; who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill?</hi> and the Lord anſwered him, <hi>Hee that walketh uprightly and worketh righteouſneſſe, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth evil to his neighbour, &amp;c. Pſ.</hi> 15.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo aſk of <hi>Iſai,</hi> how yee may faſt to pleaſe God; and hee will anſwere, <hi>It is to looſe the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:2455:240"/>
bands of wickedneſſe, to undoe the heavie burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free—to deale thy bread to the hungrie, to bring the poore, that are caſt out, to thy houſe, when thou ſeeſt a naked man, to cover him, &amp;c. Iſ.</hi> 58.6, 7. Aſk of <hi>Micah, Wherewith thou ſhalt come before God, to pleaſe him:</hi> and he will anſwere, <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee: but to do juſtly, and to love mercie? &amp;c. Micah.</hi> 6.6, 8. Aſk of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who it is, that is <hi>accepted of God;</hi> &amp; he will anſwere, It is he <hi>that feareth God and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Act.</hi> 10.34. Aſk of an Angell from heaven, who <hi>is a bleſſed man,</hi> and he will anſwere, <hi>Bleſſed are they, which do his commandements,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:2455:240"/>
that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in, through the gates into the Citie. Apoc.</hi> 22.14. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever other like queſtion ye ſhall aſk, the Scriptures will ſtill give you the like anſwere. It is not inough to heare the word: for <hi>hearers,</hi> if they be <hi>not doers</hi> alſo, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves. Iam.</hi> 1.22. It is not inough to know Gods will: for the <hi>ſervant that knoweth his maſters will, and doeth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. Luk.</hi> 12.47. It is not inough to profeſſe CHRIST with great zele: for <hi>not every one, that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of heaven, but hee that doeth the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is in heaven,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:2455:241"/>
our Saviour. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.21. It is not inough to faſt for ſin: for to them <hi>who faſted to ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe,</hi> it was ſaid from heaven, <hi>yee ſhall not faſt, as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Iſ.</hi> 58.4. It is not inough to preach the Goſpel: for if a man do not <hi>keep under his body, and bring it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, after he hath preached unto others, himſelf may prove a caſt-away.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is not inough to prophecie, and work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and caſt out divels: for unto many ſuch Chriſt will ſay at the laſt day, <hi>I never knew you, depart from mee, yee workers of iniquitie. Matt.</hi> 7.22, 23. In all which
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:2455:241"/>
ſpeeches and ſayings, there is ſtill walking and working and doing: and without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good, there is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of life. Therefore, deare Chriſtians, what ever yee do elſe, be ſure yee do Gods will, and keepe his commandements: do your duty to God, by performing his ſervices of religion; do your duty to men, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving juſtice and true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; do your dutie to your ſelfes, by watching over your owne ſoules, that yee may take all opportunities of well-doing. This do, and your ſoules ſhall live. And ſo I end theſe Meditations with the words of the Text, <hi>Bleſſed are they, that heare the word of God and keepe it.</hi>

For the beſt work that is, may bee marred by the miſdoing of it. For avoiding of which error in this duty of hearing, our Lord hath given us a ſhort caveat, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.18: where he ſaith, <hi>Take
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:2455:244"/>
heede how ye heare.</hi> And this caveat, being propounded in brief by our Saviour, I purpoſe, Gods Spirit aſſiſting me, to enlarge with ſome few notes agreeable to the Text: intending thereby ſo to regulat our hearing, that wee may profit by it in the duties of Gods ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt then, when our Saviour ſaith, Take heede <hi>how</hi> ye heare, hee implieth in this word [how,] that we muſt regard as well the <hi>maner</hi> as the <hi>matter</hi> of the duty: the good work is not inough, unleſſe it bee done well. 2. When he ſaith, <hi>Take heede</hi> how, &amp;c. this word [Take heede] implieth two things; (1.) that there is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of erring in this duty,
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:2455:244"/>
and that unleſſe we be warie wee may doe it amiſſe: and (2.) that by heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the danger may bee prevented. For caveats are needleſſe, where there is no danger; and fruitleſſe where they do not help to avoid the danger. And theſe 3. the <hi>maner</hi> of doing, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>miſ-doing,</hi> and the profit of <hi>warineſſe</hi> in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; are the points, on which I meane by Gods grace to inſiſt.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Saviour here giveth us a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat concerning our manner of hearing: &amp; this caveat will appeare to bee the more full of reaſon, if we finde that the like rule is to bee obſerved in other the duties of Gods ſervice. And that ſo it is, may be proved thus:</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In Scriptures, as God commandeth the <hi>dutie,</hi> ſo
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:2455:245"/>
he commandeth the <hi>due ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of doing it alſo. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, hee doth not onely command us to pray but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth alſo, that wee pray in <hi>faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>without wavering. Iam.</hi> 1.6. And with <hi>fervencie</hi> and without <hi>fainting. Iam.</hi> 5.16. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. Againe, he doth not onely command us to reade, but that in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wee <hi>mark and conſider. Matt.</hi> 24.15. And ſo hee doth not onely command us to heare, but that we <hi>hearken</hi> to his words, and let them <hi>ſink downe into our eares. Luk.</hi> 9.44. and <hi>Act.</hi> 2.14. Nor doth he only command us to give almes, but beſides, that we do it cherefully, not <hi>grudgingly nor of neceſsitie,</hi> nor for the <hi>praiſe</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:2455:246"/>
of men. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. and <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4. And ſo againe, <hi>if any man ſpeake,</hi> let <hi>him ſpeake, as the Oracles of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. that is, let him ſo ſpeake Gods word, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth the word of the Almighty. And, if any man <hi>prophecie,</hi> let <hi>him prophecie according to the proportion of faith:</hi> &amp; <hi>hee, that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity;</hi> &amp;, <hi>he that ruleth, let him do it with diligence;</hi> and <hi>he that ſheweth mercy, let him do it with chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Ro.</hi> 12.6. Moreover, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Law is good, if it be uſed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8: he implieth, that a man may, but ought not to uſe Gods Law in an unlawfull maner. And when ſpeaking of the courſe of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:2455:246"/>
godlineſſe, he ſaith, <hi>So runne, that ye may obtaine.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24: Hee intimateth two things. (1.) that we ſhould not onely runne the waies of Gods commandements, but runne them in a right maner. And (2.) that if a man do not runne in a right maner, he may loſe his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour &amp; miſſe of his reward. By all this it appeareth, that God doth not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the matter of good duties, but the right maner of doing them alſo. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, if we do the thing that is commanded, yet we ſin, if wee do it not in the maner, that is required.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Good duties, if they be not done in a due maner, and with their due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:2455:247"/>
are rejected of God, as no parts of his ſervice. To this purpoſe is that which wee reade in the Prophet, <hi>To what purpoſe is the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of your ſacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord? I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, &amp; the fat of fed beaſts: and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the blood of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, or of lambs or of hee goats. When ye come to appeare before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? Bring no more vaine oblations: incenſe is an abomination unto me: the new Moones and Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the calling of aſſemblies I cannot away with: it is ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, even the ſolemne mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Your new Moones and your appointed feaſts my ſoule hateth: they are a trouble unto
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:2455:247"/>
me: I am weary to beare them.</hi> And <hi>when ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide my eies from you; yet, when ye make many prayers, I will not heare: your hands are full of blood. Iſ.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. In this paſſage wee may note theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: (1.) the works and ſervices, which theſe men performed, and they were <hi>multitude of ſacrifices, burnt offerings of rams, fat of fed beaſts, &amp;c.</hi> They were alſo keeping of <hi>new Moones and Sabbaths &amp; ſolemn aſſemblies, &amp;c.</hi> All which were ſervices commanded in Gods Law, and directed and ſerving to his glorie. (2.) Conſider the acceptation and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, that God gave to theſe ſervices of pietie and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:2455:248"/>
religion: and that is 1. he renounceth them, as none of his ſervices; <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>required theſe things at your hands?</hi> 2. He complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of them, as of heavie burdens, that oppreſſed him, <hi>I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, &amp;c: they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to beare them.</hi> 3. Hee ſheweth his diſlike and deteſtation of them; <hi>I delight not in the blood of bulls, &amp;c. incenſe is an abomination unto me: the new Moones and Sabbaths I cannot away with.</hi> 4. Hee threatneth the doers of theſe ſervices with his high diſpleaſure; <hi>When ye ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, &amp;c.</hi> This is the welcome that theſe
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:2455:248"/>
duties found at Gods hands. (3.) Conſider the reaſon, why God accepted no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſervices of his owne appointment, and that is ſet downe in the laſt words; <hi>Your hands are full of blood.</hi> The meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the whole ſpeech is this, that this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dealt unjuſtly, and tooke bribes and oppreſſed their poore neighbours: for this the Prophet meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>your hands are full of blood.</hi> And becauſe they brought Gods ſacrifices, and did the works of his ſervice with polluted hands, and defiled hearts, therefore he rejected both them, and their devotions, though otherwiſe they were works
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:2455:249"/>
of his owne preſcribing. And what here is ſaid of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Sabbaths &amp; Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivall aſſemblies, the like is elſwhere ſaid of faſting and humiliation and mourning. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 4, 5, 6: and <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6. And hence the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, that the beſt ſervices of God in every kinde, if they be not performed in an holy maner, and with their due circumſtances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, are of no account in Gods ſight. It followeth, Therefore not onely the matter of good duties, but the maner of doing them, is required at our hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This confuteth their error, who think they have ſerved God well, when they have done the outward
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:2455:249"/>
works contained in his Law, though void of all true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in the heart, and without the circumſtances due to ſuch workes. Such were the Jews of olde time. They ſaid unto God; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have wee faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoule, and thou takeſt no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your faſt you finde pleaſure, and exact all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Behold, ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe: ye ſhall not faſt, as yee do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high: Is it ſuch a faſt, that I have choſen? A day for a man to afflict his ſoule, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Note here (1.) the good
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:2455:250"/>
opinion, that this people had of their faſting, they thought ſo well of it, that they durſt chalenge God, as if hee had done them wrong, becauſe he did not reward their ſervice accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its worth; <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? &amp;c.</hi> (2.) Conſider the fault, that God found with this ſervice; and that is, <hi>In the day of your faſt yee finde pleaſure, &amp;c.</hi> Where wee may ſee that God doth neither denie them to have faſted, nor blame them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they faſted: he onely chalengeth them for doing it amiſſe. For whereas a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting day ſhould bee ſpent in humiliation and ſorow, they on their faſting day
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:2455:250"/>
found pleaſure, &amp; followed their delights: and whereas on the faſting day, men ſhould exerciſe themſelves in charity and good works; they faſted <hi>for ſtrife and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and to ſtrike with the fiſt of wickedneſſe.</hi> It was not then the matter, that was blame-worthy in them, but their maner of performing. They did a good work, but they did not do it well: (3.) Conſider wee the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that God paſſed on this ſervice. 1. Hee ſaith, it will not availe them, or do them any good; <hi>Ye ſhall not faſt, as yee do this day, to make your voice to bee heard on high:</hi> Which is, as if he ſhould ſay, It is a ſpeciall vertue of an holy faſt, that it carieth our
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:2455:251"/>
prayers through the clouds, and preſenteth them before the Throne of grace: but this faſt of yours hath no ſuch vertue, it gaineth no audience to your prayers. 2. God denieth this faſt to bee any part of his ſervice, or any duty that he required or will accept of; <hi>Is this the faſt, that I have choſen, &amp;c?</hi> And ſo in concluſion, though they tooke great paines, &amp; (as they thought) had highly merited Gods favour: Yet all was to no purpoſe, becauſe though they performed a good work, yet they did not do it in a right maner. Thus <hi>Iſai</hi> ſpeakerh of a religious faſt joyned with an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life. <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:2455:251"/>
like of other holy duties in the like caſe. The place is <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.8, 9, 10, 11. The words are; <hi>Behold, yee truſt in lying words, that can not profit. Will ye ſteale, murder and commit adultery, and ſweare falſly, and burne incenſe to Baal, and walk after other gods, whom yee know not; and come and ſtand before me in this houſe, which is called by my name, and ſay, Wee are delivered to do all theſe abominations? Is this houſe, which is called by my name, become a den of Robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have ſeene it, ſaith the Lord.</hi> In theſe words theſe things are conſiderable, (1.) what the works were, that this people performed; and they were theſe, they praied
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:2455:252"/>
and praiſed God, and did all ſuch ſervices, as were uſuall in the Temple: for that is meant by this phraſe, <hi>ye come and ſtand before mee in this houſe.</hi> (2.) What confidence they had in theſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, <hi>They truſted in lying words, ſaying, Wee are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, &amp;c.</hi> (3.) What the defect of theſe ſervices was; and that was that together with theſe good works, they joyned their owne ſinnes, murder and ſtealing and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for advantage. (4) What cenſure God paſſed on theſe devotions thus performed; and that was in theſe two things: 1. that they <hi>truſted in lying words:</hi> and 2. that by them they profaned Gods houſe, and made it, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:2455:252"/>
then <hi>a den of thieves,</hi> therein to hide their wicked deeds. This was the errour of the ancient Jews in the daies of the Prophets. And the like was the error of the Scribes and Phariſes in our Saviours time: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſaith of them, <hi>yee make cleane the outſide of the cup and the platter: but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedneſſe. Luk.</hi> 11.39. And the like hath beene the errour of ſome ſeduced Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in our owne time, who think they have ſerved God well, when they have gone over <hi>their beads,</hi> &amp; mumbled over a taile of <hi>Latin prayers,</hi> which they underſtand not. Nor is the errour of ſome looſe livers amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g our ſelves,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:2455:253"/>
any thing leſſe or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, who deteſting the ſuperſtitions of the Papiſts, do but change theirs for an other ſuperſtition of their own: ſuch I meane, as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their religion by the number of the Sermons, which they heare, as the other meaſured theirs by the number of prayers, which they counted on their beads or on their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ends. Theſe, if they heare often, &amp; pray much, &amp; repeate Sermons at home, they think they are highly in Gods favour; though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they ſlander their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and revile their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and condemne all for reprobats, that dance not after their pipe. I ſpeake
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:2455:253"/>
not this to caſt any aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on thoſe holy duties of hearing and praying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting of what wee have heard: but to detect their follie and iniquitie, who make theſe holy exerciſes a cloke for their ſin, and a ground of their cenſorious pride. <hi>Iſai</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> did not ſpeake againſt faſting and ſacrifices, when they reproved the hypocrits of their time, for abuſing thoſe duties in an unholy maner. And no more do I meane the leaſt word againſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and praying and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; when I tax the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits of our time, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting theſe good works to a bad end. I would have all of us to honour God by
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:2455:254"/>
theſe duties, and not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him by mingling them with hypocriſie and bad dealing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Hence wee may learne not to content our ſelves with the deede done; but that when we are about an holy work, we do it alſo in an holy maner, and with the due circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or required in ſuch a work. Now, to ſpeak more diſtinctly, there are three conditions required in every good work: 1. That it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from a cleare conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not defiled with knowen ſin: 2. That it be with an heartie and ſincere affection: and 3. that it bee done to a right end.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. It is required in a good
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:2455:254"/>
worke that it proced, from a <hi>good conſcience</hi> free from knowen ſin. For <hi>to the wicked</hi> and diſobedient man, <hi>God ſaith, What haſt thou to do, to declare my ſtatuts; or that thou ſhouldeſt take my covenant within thy mouth? Seeing thou hateſt inſtruction, and caſteſt my words behinde thee. Pſ.</hi> 50.16, 17. The meaning is, as if he ſhould ſay, It pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to thee, to profeſſe religion, ſeeing thou doeſt not practice it. And ſo if any man having a polluted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, take upon him to preach Gods word, God may ſay to him; <hi>What haſt thou to do to teach my Law,</hi> which thou obſerveſt not? And if any ſuch do come to heare Gods word, God may

ſay to him; <hi>what haſt thou to do to heare,</hi> who art reſolved not to obey? And if ſuch a one ſhall come to pray or to praiſe God, with his people, God may ſay to him; <hi>what haſt thou to do, to pray unto me,</hi> or to praiſe mee with thy mouth, who blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt me daily in thy deeds? But moſt of all, if any ſuch ſhall come to partake of the holy Communion, God may ſay to him; <hi>what haſt thou to do, to eate my bread,</hi> who doeſt lift up the heele againſt me? Or, to ſuch a one our Lord may ſay as he did to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manerly gueſt in the Goſpel, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having on a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment? Matt.</hi> 22.11. Nor is this all: it followeth
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:2455:255"/>
in the ſame Text, <hi>Take him away, and caſt him into outer darknes: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> This is the caſe and the condition of them, who performe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervices of religion, while they have conſciences within defiled with knowen ſin. The application here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to our ſelves is this; that therefore we do in this, as <hi>David</hi> did in the like caſe. He reſolved, <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, O Lord, and ſo will I compaſſe thine Altar. Pſal.</hi> 26.6: meaning,<note place="margin">Exod. 30 19, 21.</note> that as the Prieſts, before they offered ſacrifice, did firſt waſh their hands and feete: ſo he would waſh his ſoule in innocencie? and cleanſe his hands from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:2455:256"/>
and wrong; and then he would offer up his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices unto God. And ſo muſt wee do: Firſt cleanſe our ſoules from ſin, &amp; then go to eate at Gods board, and to heare his word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and to offer up our prayers and praiſes to his name. A polluted heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe an acceptable work. This then is the firſt condition in a good work, that it proceede from a good heart, free from knowen ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond is, that it be done with upright and <hi>heartie affection.</hi> For <hi>God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a cherefull Giver.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. And ſo I may ſay, God loveth a cherefull <hi>hearer,</hi> and a cherefull <hi>receiver,</hi> and

a cherefull <hi>Petitioner,</hi> and a cherefull <hi>doer</hi> in all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. But when men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed not heartie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he complaineth of it, &amp; threatneth them for their hollow-hearted ſervice. <hi>For aſmuch,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>as this people draw neare unto me with their mouth, &amp; with their lips do honor me; but have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their heart farre from me: Therefore, behold, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to do a marvellous work among this people: — for the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall bee hid. Iſ.</hi> 29.13. And ſo, if any man come to heare Gods word with his eares, or to pray with his lips, or to preſent himſelfe at Gods

board with his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while ſend his heart an other way, either not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or not caring, or not affecting the worke in hand: the reproofe will be as juſt againſt him; <hi>This man draweth neare unto mee with his</hi> mouth and his eares and his outward parts; but his heart and his ſoule are farre removed away. And where his heart is, there is his treaſure: and where his treaſure is, thence muſt hee expect his reward. Hereof this muſt bee the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>My heart and my fleſh rejoice in the living God. Pſ.</hi> 84.2. meaning that the joy of his heart did ſpread
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:2455:257"/>
it ſelfe into the parts of this body; ſo ſhould it bee with us; <hi>Our heart and our mouth,</hi> ſhould receive the bleſſed Sacrament; and <hi>our heart and our eares</hi> ſhould heare the word preached &amp; read; and <hi>our heart and our hand</hi> ſhould give almes to the poore. And ſo in all other the like caſes. For as when <note n="*" place="margin">Plutar, in vita Julii Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar. pag. 737. Val. Max. l. 1. cap. 6. num. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Ceſar</hi> offered ſacrifice, it was counted an ominous thing for him, that there was no heart found in the beaſt that was ſlaine: ſo it portendeth us no good, if our heart bee abſent, when we pray and heare &amp; praiſe God for his mercies.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It is required in a good work, that it be done for a <hi>right end,</hi> that is, that
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:2455:258"/>
God, whoſe ſervice it is, may bee honored by it. So S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man ſpeake, let him ſpeake, as the Oracles of God;</hi> and, <hi>if any man miniſter, let him do it, as of the abilitie, which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; that God in all things may bee glorified through</hi> JESUS CHRIST, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. And S. <hi>Paul, Whether ye eate or drink or whatſoever yee do; do all to the glory of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Gods glory then is the right end for which all good workes muſt bee done. And when men neglected or miſſed of this end in their good workes, God upbraideth them with it; <hi>When ye faſted and mourned,—did yee at all faſt unto mee, even to mee?
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:2455:258"/>
And when ye did eat, &amp; when ye did drink, did yee not eat for your ſelves, &amp; drinke for your ſelves? Zach.</hi> 7.5, 6. Of ſuch ſervices as theſe, which are void of their right end, our Lord giveth us this caveat; <hi>Take heede that ye do not your almes before men, to bee ſeene of them: otherwiſe, ye have no reward of your father, which is in Heaven. Matt.</hi> 6.1. And ſo, if <hi>wee</hi> preach to gaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe from men, and <hi>yee</hi> heare, to make a ſhew of your zeale, and if any of us give almes, or do any other work, not for Gods glorie, but for our owne ends; it is a lame ſacrifice, not rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable by the Almighty. And hereof we ſhould make this application to our ſelves;
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:2455:259"/>
that as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf and his fellow-workmen in the Goſpell, <hi>Wee preach not our ſelves, but</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>the</hi> LORD, <hi>and our ſelves your ſervants for</hi> JESUS <hi>ſake.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. So wee ſhould ſhew the like faithfulneſſe in all our good works, that wee ſeeke not our owne ends, but Gods glory in them. And if thus wee performe our holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, it will bee ſaid of us and of them, as it was of <hi>Abel</hi> and his ſacrifice, <hi>The Lord had reſpect to Abel and his offering. Gen.</hi> 4.4. The LORD will accept both of our perſons and our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; ſo that nothing which wee doe for Gods glory, but will prove to be

alſo for our own profit. God give us the grace, that wee may bee fruitfull in good workes and faithfull in the right doing of them to <hi>Gods</hi> glory; that in all things GOD may bee gloried through JESUS CHRIST.</p>

This may bee further confirmed by the parable of the Sower; the ſcope whereof is, to ſhew us the diverſitie that is found among hearers: &amp; the iſſue thereof is, that of

foure ſorts there recited 3. are like bad ground, which <hi>bringeth forth no fruit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> And that proveth, that the greateſt part of hearers, do heare amiſſe, &amp; without profit.

But
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:2455:261"/>
he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me all ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.

By theſe ſayings it appeareth, that there are ſome, which received not profit by their hearing, no, not of the gratious words that proceeded out of our Saviours mouth: &amp; thence I conclude, that therefore they heard amiſſe; for the word of God, if the fault be not in the hearer, is the <hi>power of God to ſalvation. Rom.</hi> 1.16. But I only name theſe proofes, becauſe I
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:2455:261"/>
chooſe rather to inſiſt on ſuch teſtimonies, as do both ſhew us, that there may be a fault in our hearing, and do alſo tell us what that fault is: that by the one wee may ſee how neceſſary it is, to bee heedfull, leſt we heare amiſſe; and by the other how to avoid the errour, that doth procure the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe I obſerve five ſorts of bad hearers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Scriptures; 1. Heedleſſe hearers, 2. Partiall hearers, 3. Forgetfull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, 4. Senſuall hearers, and 5. Fruitleſſe hearers, or ſuch as do not obey the word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto them.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The firſt are <hi>heedleſſe</hi> and negligent hearers: and
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:2455:262"/>
they be ſuch as heare, but do not marke or attend to that which is ſpoken. Such as theſe they were, of whom <hi>Iſai</hi> complaineth; <hi>Heare yee deaf, and looke ye blinde, that yee may ſee.</hi>—Hee goeth on; <hi>Seeing many things, but thou obſerveſt not; opening the eares, but hee heareth not. Iſa.</hi> 42.18, 20. Note here (1.) the fault, with which they are charged: they are ſaid to be <hi>deaf and blinde.</hi> (2) the explication or declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewing, wherein this fault conſiſted; <hi>Seeing many things, but thou obſerveſt not: &amp;c.</hi> hee meaneth that they heard and ſaw, but they did not mark and obſerve, what they heard. And for this cauſe he calleth them <hi>blinde
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:2455:262"/>
and deaf;</hi> becauſe no man is ſo blinde and deaf, as he that will not ſee and heare. (3.) Wee may conſider the meanes, by which this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour may be amended: and that is in theſe words, <hi>Heare and looke;</hi> by which he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that they ſhould attend and mark what they heard. Laie theſe together, and the fault will appeare to be this, that while they heard and came to learne, they did not obſerve what was ſaid. And the like to this was their fault, of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Yee are dull of hearing. For when for the time, ye ought to be Teachers; ye have need that one teach you againe, which be the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Oracles of God,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:2455:263"/>
Heb.</hi> 5.11. Here the Apoſtle chargeth them with two things: (1.) that they were <hi>dull of hearing.</hi> By which word hee meaneth not any naturall imperfection; for then he would rather have pitied them, then have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them: but hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their <hi>wilfull</hi> careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and negligence, by reaſon whereof ſcarſe could any thing bee beaten into their heads. (2.) Hee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited not by the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as they might and ſhould have done. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the meanes that was afforded them, and the time that they enjoyed it, they might become <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> if they had beene at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:2455:263"/>
hearers; Whereas now by reaſon of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence they had need to bee catechized in the firſt principles. The ſumme is, They were negligent in hearing: and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued dullards in Chriſts ſchoole. And the like will be our fault, if when we come to heare Gods word either read or preached, we ſuffer our mindes to gadd abroad, by muſing on our merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing, or our bargaining, or our huſbandrie, or our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at home: or, which is not much better, if we give our ſelves over to ſleepineſs or deadneſſe of ſpirit; as I have noted ſome to laie their heads upon their deſk, as if they meant that ſhould
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:2455:264"/>
be their pillow to ſleep on; and to pull their hat about their eyes, as if they meant to draw the curtaines about the bed, and bid good night to the Preacher. They that heare in this ſort; out of doubt doe heare amiſſe, if they heare at all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our Saviour ſaid, Take heed how ye heare, he meant among other things, that wee ſhould beware of negligence in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The next is, of ſuch, as bee <hi>partiall</hi> hearers: men, who will hearken to Gods word, while it accordeth with their luſts; but will none of it, when it croſſeth their deſires. And theſe are of two ſorts: (1.) ſuch as
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:2455:264"/>
will abide no doctrin, which agreeth not with their own fanſie, and thoſe leſſons, which they have received from their owne Maſters: and (2.) ſuch, as will endure no admonitions, that ſtrike at the ſins, in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They that will not abide any <hi>doctrine,</hi> which twharteth their received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. Such were the Jews, of whom wee reade, that when <hi>Paul ſpake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more ſilence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this hee ſeemed the better affected to their nation. But when he tould them, that GOD bade him, <hi>Depart from Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; becauſe hee would ſend
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:2455:265"/>
him farre thence to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> the Text ſaith, that <hi>they gave him audience unto that word; but then they lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up their voices and ſaid, Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he ſhould live. Act.</hi> 22.2, 22. And ſuch like were the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, of whom wee reade, that they joyned with the Sadduces to accuſe <hi>Paul:</hi> but when <hi>Paul</hi> had once ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 23 6, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Men and brethren, I am a Phariſee, the ſonne of a Phariſee; of the hope and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead I am called in queſtion:</hi> the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees perceiving that <hi>Paul</hi> tooke their part againſt the Sadduces, whoſe enemies they were, then they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their note, and, <hi>Wee
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:2455:265"/>
finde no evill in this man,</hi> ſay they: <hi>but if a ſpirit or an Angell have ſpoken unto him, let us not fight againſt God.</hi> The fault of both theſe ſorts of men was, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and magnified the Preacher, while hee ſpake agreeably to their opinions; but perſecuted him, when he croſſed their Traditions and cuſtomes. And the like is the fault of many men at this day. Let a Preacher ſpeake any thing in favour of their opinions, and they magnifie him, for a man of rare parts: but let him once but croſſe or gaineſay that which they beleeve to bee true, &amp; he ſhall be debaſed, as unworthy to tread upon the ground. In which kind,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:2455:266"/>
I have met with ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, ſo ſtiffe in what they have beene taught, that a man might as ſoone charme a deaf adder, as perſwade them to conſider of any reaſon. And among our brethren of the German Churches, a great number are ſo wedded to Luthers opinions, that they eſteeme every ſaying of his, as an Oracle from heaven; and, as <note n="(a)" place="margin">Non-nulli in illius (Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis aut factis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino pati nequeſit, &amp; ſiquis hoc face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, cum ſtatim impietatis reum declamitando peragunt.

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:2455:267"/>
heatheniſh Romans, who forbade the making of any new God, but ſuch as the Senat did approve: <hi>[Apud vos de humano arbitratu divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas penſitatur;] Among you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Gods are eſteemed, as men pleaſe:</hi> and <hi>[Niſi ho mini Deus placuerit, Deus non erit,] If God do not pleaſe men, he muſt bee no God at all.</hi> And ſo I may ſay of theſe men, Among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth of God is reckoned by the opinion of men: if it be not approved by ſuch a man, as they follow, it ſhall bee no truth at all.</p>
                     <p>This partiality towards Gods ſervants, is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to Gods glory: againſt which our Saviour giveth this caveat, <hi>Call no

John Baptiſt <hi>gladly,</hi> &amp; <hi>when he heard him, did many things</hi> according to his direction. But when he tould the King, It is not lawfull for thee to have thy brothers wife; then inſteede of hearing him, and following his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, he firſt ſent him to the priſon, and then to the block. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.17, 18, 20, &amp;c. And as bad or worſe were they, who <hi>ſaid to the Seers, See not; and to the Prophets, Prophecie not unto us right things: ſpeake unto us ſmooth things, Prophecie deceits. Iſa.</hi> 30.10. Where we may not ſo conſtrue the Text, as if this people did utter thoſe expreſſe words: they were not ſo ſhameleſſe, or ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of reaſon. But it is the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:2455:272"/>
maner of Scriptures, to put into mens mouths thoſe words which are agreeable to their thoughts: according to which rule, when the Prophet ſaith, they <hi>ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy not right things,</hi>  we muſt underſtand him to meane, that ſuch were their thoughts, as might very fitly bee expreſſed by theſe words, or that they did in effect as good as ſay ſo: for either they maligned and oppoſed the Prophets, when they tould them of their ſins; or elſe they withdrew their maintenance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from them: but if any would ſing a Nightingalls ſong, and ſpeak that which either might countenance, or did not controll their ill-dealings,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:2455:272"/>
hee was the man that carried away all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And like to theſe were thoſe of whom <hi>Micah</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; <hi>If a man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>walking in the ſpirit and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, do lie, ſaying, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to thee of ſtrong drink, he ſhall even bee the Prophet of this people. Micah</hi> 2.11. Hee meaneth that ſuch a Teacher would be the onely man of account with them; they would even put him into their boſom. Thus it hath beene in old time, and the like may be obſerved to bee uſuall among us at this day. For there is no man, who is reſolved to go on in a ſin; but he is grieved, when hee heareth it gaineſaid by the Preacher: nor is there any
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:2455:273"/>
man lightly, but will bee glad to heare that ſin gently handled, wherewith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is delighted. Of <hi>Ahab</hi> wee read that hee <hi>hated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> becauſe he <hi>never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied good, but evill</hi> unto him: that is, hee preached that, which pleaſed him not. And ſo wee ſee it to happen ſtill: wicked men will hate the Preacher, who telleth them the truth.</p>
                     <p>This hatred againſt the true Prophets, as it is ſeene in all ſorts of carnall men; ſo more eſpecially in theſe two ſorts of ſinners, (1.) in them who bee in higher place, &amp; (2.) in them who, contribute to the Preachers maintenance: for the one ſort think themſelves privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:2455:273"/>
from reproof by their greatneſſe above him; and the other ſort, by their well-deſervings towards him. And therefore, as the firſt do over-aw him by their power, that for feare of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure hee may holde his peace: ſo the ſecond ſort do over-aw him by their purſe, that for feare of loſſe he may forbeare them. In either kindes we have an example in the Scriptures: the former in <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the later in <hi>Balak</hi> the King of <hi>Moab.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. The firſt is in <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> of him and his Courtiers wee read, that when <hi>Amos</hi> preached againſt them for their idolatrie; <hi>Amaziah the prieſt of Bethel, ſaid unto Amos;
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:2455:274"/>
O thou Seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Iudah, and there eat bread, and prophecy there. But Prophecy not any more at Bethel: for it is the Kings Chappell, and it is the King Court. Amos</hi> 7.12. Note heere (1.) what <hi>Amaziah</hi> permitteth him to do; and that is, to <hi>prophecy in Iudah,</hi> &amp; there to ſpeake his mind, if he pleaſed. (2.) What hee forbiddeth him to do; and that is, he may not preach <hi>any more at Bethel</hi> in that maner: and (3.) why hee might not preach in Bethel in this rough maner; and that is, becauſe it was <hi>the Kings Chappell, and the Kings Court.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, that elſwhere, hee might take leave, and be welcome,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:2455:274"/>
but the King and his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers would not endure ſo much boldneſſe. And juſt ſo is it now a dayes among us. We may tell an Artificer, or a Labourer, or an huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a ſervant, or any ſuch kinde of man; we may tell them of their faults freely, and without danger: but if wee touch a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a Gentle-man, or an Alderman, or a Great moneyed man, we do it at our perill and ſhall bee ſure to raiſe hornets about our eares. Thus worldly men, if they bee in higher place, think themſelves priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from reproof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond example is in <hi>Balak</hi> the King of <hi>Moab.</hi> Of him we read that he ſent
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:2455:275"/>
for <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. But <hi>Balaam</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to curſe, becauſe God did forbid and reſtrain him: &amp; hereupon the Text ſaith, that <hi>Balaks anger was kindled againſt</hi> Balaam, <hi>and he ſmote his hands together and ſaid; I called thee to curſe mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and behold thou haſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together bleſſed them theſe three times. Therefore now flee thou to thy place. I thought to promote thee to great honor, but lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour. Num.</hi> 24.10, 11. Note here, (1.) what <hi>Balak</hi> intended for <hi>Balaam,</hi> if hee would curſe where he bade him: &amp; that was great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; <hi>I thought to promote thee to great honour.</hi> (2.) Why he withdrew his hand, and
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:2455:275"/>
ſent him away emptie: and that was becauſe he did that, which GOD had charged him to do, and did not what <hi>Balak</hi> required of him. And therefore ſaith he, <hi>God hath kept thee from honour.</hi> And juſt ſo is it now a dayes. They that give benevolence to the Preacher, looke that he ſhould curſe, where they would have him curſe, and bleſſe where they would have him bleſſe, or which is all one, praiſe and defend that which they would have praiſed, and diſgrace and condemne thoſe and that which they cannot abide: and if at any time hee fall upon that ſin, which pleaſeth them, then as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Abſalom, Deale gently with
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:2455:276"/>
the young man for my ſake.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5: ſo they expect that the Preacher ſhould deale gently with that ſin for their ſake. All theſe men are partiall hearers, who will heare nothing with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but what pleaſeth themſelves: men, who come not to learne of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, what they ſhould do, but to teach the Preacher, what he ſhall ſpeak. Which is all one, as if the Scholar ſhou'd tell his maſter, what leſſons he ſhould teach him. Thus ſome for their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; others for their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie exempt themſelves from juſt reproofe, which is one taſk that the Preacher hath to performe in Gods name. Theſe then are all of them
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:2455:276"/>
                        <hi>partiall</hi> hearers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for bad hearers, becauſe they refuſe to learne what God doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Preacher to teach them. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Take heede how ye heare,</hi> hee meant among other things, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of <hi>partiality</hi> in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and that wee ſhould ſubmit to every word of God, how croſſe ſoever it bee either to our opinions, or to our practice.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third ſort are <hi>forgetfull</hi> hearers; ſuch as through negligence and careleſſeneſſe, let ſlip out of their memories, what they have learned or heard, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his owne dreame. For
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:2455:277"/>
God had ſent him a dreame to inſtruct him in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his ſtate &amp; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but before the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning came, he had forgotten, what his dreame was. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.5, 8. And ſo it is with theſe men. God teacheth them by his word, the myſteries of his Kingdom, &amp; the meanes of their ſalvation, and they immediatly forget, what was ſaid, as if they had been in a dreame all the while. Thus farre they are like <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar;</hi> but unlike him in this, that he uſed all diligence to finde out the dreame, but theſe men heare and forget, and never think of it after. S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith of fruitleſſe hearers, that they are <hi>like to a man, who beholdeth
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:2455:277"/>
his naturall face in a glaſſe, and goeth his way, and ſtraight way forgetteth what maner of man he was. Iam.</hi> 1.23, 24. He meaneth, that as ſuch a man forgetteth, what he ſaw, ſo theſe men forget what they heare. For defect in practice, and neglect of remembrance uſually go together. For if any man have no care to do Gods will, hee will have no mind to remember his word: and if any man do forget the word, he hath left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe no meanes to performe it. And therefore in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe to <hi>forget God,</hi> and his commandements, is as much as to neglect both him and them: as,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.139.</note> when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My Zele hath conſumed me, becauſe mine enemies have
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:2455:278"/>
forgetten thy words;</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that they did not think on them, much leſſe did they keepe and performe them. And many ſuch wee have now a dayes, even among them, who profeſſe religion. They go from the Church to their houſes, and from Sermon to dinner, and from hearing of Gods word to talking of the things of the world; but never call to mind what they have heard, nor conſider what uſe it may ſerve them for. Such men do quickly forget all, and practice nothing. Our leſſon in this caſe is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us by the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>We ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things, which wee have heard, leſt at
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:2455:278"/>
any time wee ſhould let them ſlipp. Heb.</hi> 2.1. The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlateth it, <hi>ne quando perfluamus,</hi> that wee do not at any time runne out. In which ſpeech the Apoſtle compareth forgetfull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to leaking veſſels: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as thoſe veſſels let out by the chincks, what they received by the mouth; ſo theſe hearers let out at one eare, what they received at the other. And becauſe they keepe not, what they heare, they loſe the profit of their hearing; like men, who eate, and caſt up what they have eaten, without receiving nouriſhment by it. Theſe then are a third ſort of bad hearers: &amp; therefore when
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:2455:279"/>
our Lord ſaid, <hi>Take heed how ye heare,</hi> he meant we ſhould bee ware, that wee bee not careleſſe and forgetfull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
                     <p n="4">IIII. A fourth ſort of bad hearers are wanton or <hi>ſenſuall</hi> hearers; ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have their eares tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with fine phraſes, rather then their ſoules ſetled with holeſome doctrine. Such hearers were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, of whom it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 17.21. that <hi>they ſpent their time in nothing elſe, but either to tell or to heare ſome newes.</hi> And ſome ſuch like were they, of whom God ſpeaketh to the Prophet, <hi>Sonne of man, the children of thy people—ſpeake one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—ſaying, Come, I pray
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:2455:279"/>
you, and heare what is the word that commeth forth from the</hi> LORD. <hi>And they come to thee, as the people cometh, &amp;c. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice and can play well on an inſtrument: For they heare thy words, but they do them not. Ezek.</hi> 33.30, 31, 32. Where wee may note, that though this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhewed great zele in flocking to the Prophets Sermons; Yet all that they cared for was to pleaſe themſelves in his words: not unlike them, who heare a piper, or a fidler, becauſe they delight in the muſick.

                        <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> compareth to women, who gather out of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens ſuch flowers, as may make a noſegay, or adorne the windows of their houſe: and I may not unfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among us, who with great coſt and care plant Tulips and ſtrange flowers, which delight the eie with

varietie of colours, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not either pott herbs, that may ſerve for meate, or phyſicall flowers, that are fit for medicine. But good hearers ſaith <hi>Plutarch,</hi> are more like to <hi>Bees.</hi> For as they ſit upon thyme and ſuch other herbs, whence they may gather moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, though they be bitter and unpleaſant to the taſte: ſo good hearers delight in ſuch Teachers, from whom they may gather beſt caveats againſt ſinne, and beſt rules, for a godly life; and out of every Sermon they will pick that, which is moſt for their ſoules health, though it have ſome bitterneſſe and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant reliſh with it. If men then, in hearing of Sermons,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:2455:281"/>
reſpect the tickling of the eare with fine words, rather then the ſtabliſhing of the ſoule with holeſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; theſe are a ſort of bad hearers. And therefore, when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Take heede how ye heare;</hi> he meant, that among other faults in our hearing, we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of <hi>itching</hi> eares, which love vain delight more then ſolid doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The fifth and laſt ſort of bad hearers are thoſe that bee <hi>fruitleſſe,</hi> which heare, but do not; like the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe figge tree, which made a faire ſhew by its greene leaves, but had no fruit, that might refreſh nature.

                        <pb n="520" facs="tcp:2455:282"/>1. <hi>Proud</hi> men I call ſuch, who when they know what God commandeth, and are in conſcience convinced of the truth; yet will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Gods Law, but break through all without feare. Such were the Iewes, of whom <hi>Ieremy</hi> writeth, that when hee had told them of their idolatrie, with Gods expreſſe command to the contrary, they anſwered, <hi>As for the word, which thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee:</hi> but wee will doe whatſoever goeth out of our owne mouth, &amp;c. <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.16.

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:2455:282"/>
by the ſame Prophet. <hi>Ieremie</hi> had told them from God, that they ſhould not goe into Egypt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42. and then it followeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 43. <hi>Then ſpake Azariah and Ioha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, and all the proud men, ſaying to Ieremiah, Thou ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt falſely: the Lord our God hath not ſent thee to ſay, Goe not into Egypt, to ſojourne there. But Baruch the ſonne of Neriah ſetteth thee on againſt us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, &amp;c. So—they obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Iudah, Ier.</hi> 43.2, 3, 4. In theſe paſſages of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, note, (1.) the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene theſe two ſorts of men: the firſt are peremptory and plaine, <hi>We
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:2455:283"/>
will not hearken,</hi> ſay they; but the latter maketh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, though an unjuſt one, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt falſely,</hi> ſay they to the Prophet: and, <hi>The Lord hath not ſent thee, &amp;c.</hi> (2.) Conſider their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the like ſinne, they both refuſed to hearken, and obey Gods word. (3.) See the cenſure, that God paſſeth on them, which is that they are <hi>proud men.</hi> For ſo it is expreſſely ſaid of the more manerly ſort, and therefore muſt neceſſarily be meant of the more peremptory: if he bee a <hi>proud man,</hi> that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, becauſe he ſaith the Lord had not ſaid ſo; hee is much more <hi>proud,</hi> that ſaith, I will not hearken to the word of the Lord. And
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:2455:283"/>
                        <hi>proud</hi> men the Prophet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they durſt withſtand Gods word, when it is evidently declared unto them. And ſo in our dayes, wee have ſome that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, and ſay they will do it the rather, becauſe the Preacher prateth ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Others are more manerly in making of excuſes; ſometimes they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge danger, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their care for wife and children, and ſometimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of neceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſuch other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, like the gueſts in the Goſpel, who thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves excuſed becauſe they had <hi>maried a wife,</hi> and <hi>bought a yoke of oxen,</hi> and purchaſed a piece of Land.

it is true, that they may rightly be called proud men, if they preſume to diſobey when Gods will is made manifeſt to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:2455:285"/>
they bee bad and ungodly hearers. For <hi>if any man heare my words</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>and doth them not, he is like a man, who without a foundation built an houſe upon the earth, againſt which the ſtreame did beat vehemently, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly it fell, and the ruine of that houſe was great. Luk,</hi> 6.48, 49. And therefore I may conclude of theſe, as I did of the reſt; when our Lord ſaid, <hi>Take heed how yee heare;</hi> he meant that among other vices in hearers, wee ſhould take heed of <hi>fruitleſſe</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, when men heare and doe not.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone through the ſeverall ſorts of bad hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. I now deſire every Chriſtian, that ſhall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:2455:286"/>
to reade theſe lines, that after his reading, hee will examine himſelfe by theſe notes. I ſuppoſe hee hath beene an hearer of Gods word for ſome ſpace of time; and doth ſtill continue in that practice for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſoule.

And ſure the labour is all loſt, which is beſtowed upon ſuch as bee bad hearers, of whom hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have ſpoken. Let every Chriſtian then in the

And that is the point, which after the danger diſcovered, commeth now to be ſpoken of. For better proceeding wherein, wee are in the firſt

                        </gap>, <hi>See, looke,</hi> or <hi>take heed,</hi> doth naturally import. And the later of them is implied in the intention of the ſpeaker. For ſearching after availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meanes is vaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making uſe of them after they are found. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when our Lord ſaid, <hi>Take heed how yee heare,</hi> hee
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:2455:288"/>
meant that wee ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how wee may heare with profit, that wee loſe not the fruit of our labour; and that what rules we find to be good for the purpoſe, we make uſe of them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that our ſpeculation may be ſeconded by our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. For our better directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of foure ſorts of duties neceſſary for this purpoſe. The firſt are duties going before our hearing; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond are duties or rules to bee obſerved in the time of our hearing; the third are ſuch as are to bee practiced after the end of our hearing; &amp; the laſt are common &amp; do diffuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves through all theſe differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of time. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:2455:288"/>
with the firſt of theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Firſt then, before we come to heare, there are certaine <hi>preparative</hi> duties, that may fit and prepare us for the work. For Gods word is like <hi>ſeede</hi> ſowen by the Preacher; and the Hearers are like the ground, in which this ſeed is ſowen, as our Saviour hath taught us in the parable of the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, immediatly preceding this caveat of heed-taking how we heare. Now no wiſe man will ſow his ſeed till he have manured his ground. He will firſt plough &amp; dung, and gather out the ſtones &amp; the rubbiſh, and then caſt in his ſeed with hope of a plentifull harveſt: and ſo we, before the ſeed of Gods
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:2455:289"/>
word bee ſowen in our hearts, we muſt take care, that they bee prepared and made fit ſoile to receive ſuch ſeed in. This is meant by that of <hi>Ieremie, Break up your fallow ground, and ſow not among thornes. Ieremie</hi> 4.3. He meaneth, that as no man doth ſow his ſeed before he have ploughed the ground &amp; pulled up the weeds and thornes; for elſe all, both labour and ſeed would bee loſt, ſo every wiſe ſervant of God, ſhould prepare his heart before the ſeeds of grace and good inſtructions be ſowen in it. For elſe, if the heart of a man bee hard and without feeling, like the <hi>high way</hi> ſide, that is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by often treading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:2455:289"/>
it; it will not open or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe it ſelfe to receive the ſeed. And if it be filled with the cares of the world &amp; the love of riches and pleaſures, like the <hi>thornie</hi> ground, that is overſpread with rubbiſh; though it receive the ſeed, yet it choketh it in the ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. It is then a point of neceſſary obſervation, that if we will heare with profit, we prepare our hearts afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that like good ground they may bring forth fruit to perfection. Now for the ploughing up of the heart, and preparing of it for the ſeed, diverſe duties are firſt to be performed, which for that cauſe I call <hi>preparative</hi> duties: and thoſe are, as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="536" facs="tcp:2455:290"/>I. The firſt <hi>preparative</hi> dutie is, that wee put off Worldly buſineſſes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie our ſoules of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts, which either might take up our time due to this worke, or diſtract our mindes in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. For looke how long the minde roveth, and ſo much of the good ſeed is ſpilt, as is ſowen in that time: and if beſides, occaſions of the world do keep us from hearing, or hinder us in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it; what in this caſe is beſtowed on the world, is ſtollen from God and our owne ſoules. And therefore in the Decalogue, where God commanded the Jews to ſanctifie the ſeventh day, as a day of reſt for
<pb facs="tcp:2455:290"/>
Gods ſervice, hee telleth them that they had ſix daies allowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do their own works in; but the ſeventh was a Sabbath of reſt, in which being freed from the world, they ſhould bee at leaſure for God. For better keeping of which day, <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded them, that the day before the Sabbath, they ſhould<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. 16.23.</note> 
                        <hi>bake, what they had to bake;</hi> and <hi>ſeeth, what they had to ſeeth;</hi> that ſo they might have no buſineſſe of their own to do, when they were to keepe Gods holy day.

generally do affirm. Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably whereunto, and (as I take it) in imitation thereof the Chriſtian Church hath beene accuſtomed to keepe Saterday half holy day, that in the afternoon they might ridd by-buſineſſes out of the way, and by the evening ſervice might prepare their mindes for the Lords day then enſuing. Which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and uſage of Gods people, as I will not preſſe it upon any mans conſcience, as a neceſſary dutie; ſo every man will grant mee, that Gods people, as well Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as Jewiſh, have thought a time of preparation moſt fit for the well obſerving of Gods holy day. And upon this ground I may be bolde
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:2455:292"/>
to adviſe every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that before the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the LORDS day, he will take care to lay aſide worldly occaſions, and to cleare his minde from the thought of them: that ſo he may have nothing to do with the world, while hee is to converſe with God, nor bee diſtracted with earthly thoughts, when hee is to bee buſied about heavenly things. In regard whereof I cannot but blame their looſeneſſe, who follow the buſineſſes of their trade in the morning of the Lords day; or ſpend other parts thereof in talking with their ſervants about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the next weeks work, as if they meant to
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:2455:292"/>
make the Lords day a <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> day for the week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. By which meanes, it falleth out not ſeldome, that ſuch people come tardy to Church, and heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attention, when they are come, and go away without profit when all is done. I like not their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour who allow no <hi>word</hi> nor <hi>thought</hi> on a Sabbath day, but ſuch as is ſpirituall: nor can I approve their looſenes, who take ſo much libertie for themſelves, as hindereth any ſubſtantiall dutie of Gods ſervice. More I ſay not at this time, grant mee but thus much, and then ye will not denie, but ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is neceſſary, as may make us fit for the duties of
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:2455:293"/>
Gods ſervice, and may make the exerciſes of an holy day profitable for our ſoules.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A ſecond <hi>preparative</hi> duty for right hearing, is that wee refreſh the body with ſeaſonable &amp; moderat comforts: that the ſenſes &amp; ſpirits being refreſhed, the minde may bee made more chearefull in Gods ſervice. For, our ſoules work, as our bodies are fitted for them: and the reaſon is, becauſe the ſenſes of the body are the ſervants of the ſoule, &amp; the ſpirits are the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by which it worketh. Now if a maſter-workman doe want ſervants to aſſiſt him, he will do but a little work: and if hee want tooles, or have none but blunt ones,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:2455:293"/>
he can do no work, or none to any pupoſe. And ſo if the bodily ſenſes bee decaied, and the ſpirits waſted; the minde cannot be free or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in good duties.

And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is cleare in experience. For we ſee that the famiſhed body is unfit for worke, and the hungrie belly thinketh more of eating &amp; drinking,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:2455:295"/>
then of praying or learning Gods word: and the man that is weary with long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, had rather ſleepe, then meditat or heare. It is ſaid of <hi>Siſera,</hi> that hee was faſt a ſleepe and weary; and the meaning is, ſay the Learned <note n="(c)" place="margin">Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabl. in Jud. 4.21.</note> 
                        <hi>preſſus ſopore prae laſsitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> that by reaſon of his wearineſs he fell into a dead ſleepe. The concluſion is, ſome refreſhing is neceſſary for the body, that it may be ſerviceable for the ſoule. And this is the firſt thing that I ſay.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, that this refreſhing muſt be <hi>ſeaſonable and moderat.</hi> For as emptines breedeth faintneſſe, ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a burden: and both of them diſable the ſoule in
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:2455:295"/>
her functions. For as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian was not able to tell his tale, when hee wanted meat: ſo <hi>Nabal</hi> was not fit for good counſell, when he was filled with wine and good cheare. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36, 37. And for this cauſe our LORD giveth us warning, <hi>Take heede to your ſelves, that your hearts be not overcharged with ſurfetting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and cares of this life; and ſo that day come upon you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares. Luk.</hi> 21.34. This ſheweth that meat &amp; drink, if they be immoderat, are a burden to the ſoule. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſleepe, if it bee ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, refreſheth nature and maketh men fit for their worke: but unſeaſonable ſleepe is an hinderance to
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:2455:296"/>
good imployments; which made <hi>Solomon</hi> to ſay, that if a man <hi>love ſleepe he will come to poverty. Pro.</hi> 20.13. &amp; 6.11. And ſo it is in the ſpirituall ſtate of mens ſoules. Thoſe that give themſelves to ſleepe, when they ſhould watch and work in Gods ſervice, will doubtleſſe come to great poverty in Gods graces. And no marvell. For if men ſleepe when they ſhould come to Church, they deprive themſelves of ſome part of Divine ſervice: and if they ſleepe when they are come, they deprive themſelves of all the fruit, that they ſhould reape by it, and conſequently they loſe the helps &amp; meanes, which God hath appointed for the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:2455:296"/>
enriching of their ſoules with divine graces. The concluſion is; Comforts of nature, in meat and ſleepe, are neceſſary for attentive hearing, ſo they bee mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſeaſonable.</p>
                     <p>But in both theſe refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings men do oftentimes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: and hee that would have good of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, muſt bee carefull to avoid thoſe errours, which be theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Men offend in eating and drinking, ſeldome in defect, but many times by exceſſe. It was ſometimes a fault among the Primitive Chriſtians (when men in their zole did take the kingdome of heaven by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence) that they faſted ſo
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:2455:297"/>
long till they fainted: and therefore were reproved by the Ancient Fathers, for their auſterity and rigour. But our times are not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of that fault. Our ſinne is, that by too full fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wee become unfit for holy duties. For <hi>whoredome and wine and new wine take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. And <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting,</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſſe, and cares of</hi> the world, do <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the heart,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep watch againſt the great day; as our Saviour ſaith. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which ſpeeches is, that by eating and drinking, and caring for the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively or overmuch, the ſoule of man is preſſed
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:2455:297"/>
downe, and laid groveling upon the earth; ſo that it is unfit for any heavenly thoughts. And this we find to bee true by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For if we feed to the full on the Lords day at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wee are the worſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to heare, or pray, or ſerve God any way in the afternoone. And therefore, if we deſire to profit by our hearing, we muſt beware of full feeding: eſpecially, we muſt take heed, that a full ſtomacke doe not cauſe a drowſie head.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In ſleeping men offend both wayes, both by defect, and exceſſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) By <hi>defect:</hi> and ſo they offend, who on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday night do continue
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:2455:298"/>
ſo long at their worke, that they are ſleepie the next day, when they ſhould ſerve God in good duties. For this wee may be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of, that they who work when they ſhould ſleepe, will ſleep when they ought to work: becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if it be defrauded of its ordinary reſt, will ſtill bee ſeeking of a ſupply of that which is wanting. And therefore thoſe, that would be cheerefull in holy exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the Lords day, muſt give themſelves ſufficient reſt the foregoing day. Yea, and if I might adviſe, they ſhould allow ſomewhat more then ordinary at that time; becauſe it is harder to forbeare ſleepe in the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:2455:298"/>
Church, where wee ſit ſtill without moving, then it will bee in our ſhops, or in places abroad, where we are ſtirring and moving about our occaſions, and intent upon our Trades and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2). Wee offend herein by <hi>exceſſe</hi> alſo. So they do, who ſlugge it ſo long in their beds on the Service-day, as that ſome part of Gods ſervice is paſt, before they are ready to come. This fault deſerveth reprofe in two reſpects. 1. Becauſe it argueth a great coldneſſe in holy duties, and a dead ſpirit to God-ward. For what wee do willingly and with a cheerefull minde, that wee do ſpeedily, and
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:2455:299"/>
without lingring or delay. Wee reade of <hi>Shechem Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi> ſonne, when hee had a grant of <hi>Dinah Iacobs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be his wife, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that hee and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would bee circumciſed; that he <hi>deferred not to doe the thing, becauſe hee had delight in Iacobs daughter. Gen.</hi> 34.19. And ſo if men have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſpirituall exerciſes, they will take the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and not deferre and loyter about the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So when <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his ſon, the Text ſaith, noting thereby his ready o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that <hi>hee roſe early in the morning,</hi> to go ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the work. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.3. And of <hi>Iacob,</hi> it is ſaid in like
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:2455:299"/>
ſort, that to expreſſe his thankfulneſſe for Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>hee roſe up early in the morning, and ſet up a pillar, &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 28.18. And ſo on the contrary of wicked men, who purſue their ſinfull pleaſures with delight, it is ſaid, that they riſe early to go about their work. So drunkards are ſaid <hi>to riſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning, that they may follow ſtrong drink. Iſa.</hi> 5.11. And the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, <hi>roſe early and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted all their doings. Zeph.</hi> 3.7. Yea, and God himſelfe, to note his hearty deſire of mans ſalvation, ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>I ſpake unto you, riſing up early and ſpeaking: but yee heard not. Ier.</hi> 7.13. and verſe 25, <hi>I have ſent unto you all my
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:2455:300"/>
ſervants the Prophets, dayly riſing up early and ſending them.</hi> By all which, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the like kind, we may ſee, that <hi>early riſing</hi> for the doing of any thing, is taken as an argument of hearty affection and love to the ſame thing. And ſo on the contrary, ſlugging and delaying, is an argument of little affection and love. And hereby it appeareth, that their devotion is cold in Gods ſervice, who lie in bed ſo long, that they come late and tardie to the worke. 2. This fault of ſlugging long in bed, is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, becauſe by comming late to Gods ſervice, they may come ſhort of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. <hi>Eſau</hi> ſtaied ſo long in
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:2455:300"/>
hunting for his Veniſon, that the bleſſing was gone, before he came to receive it. <hi>Gene.</hi> 27. And afterward he <hi>found no place for repentance,</hi> or to revoke the former grant, <hi>though hee ſought it with teares. Heb.</hi> 12.17. Let this example ſcare ſluggards out of their beds, and make our halfe-hearers, who come when a good part of the Service is paſt; to bethink themſelves, and beware leſt the bleſſing bee paſt, before they come to receive it.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme is, Hee that will heare with profit, muſt grant ſufficient refreſhing to nature, but not exceſſive; ſuch as may cheere his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but not ſuch as may dull and depreſſe them.</p>

The third <hi>prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> duty is, that before hand wee ſeaſon our minds with ſome holy thoughts in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that wee may bee the better diſpoſed to good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in publike.

                        </note> But if we turne our hearts toward God, and fixe our mindes on heavenly

things, before wee come from home; this will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to heavenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſſe in the publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. For example, let this be our practiſe, let us lift up our hearts and raiſe our thoughts to God-ward by meditating on his word and works, by thinking on our duty and the worke wee are about, by conſidering Gods greatneſſe, in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence wee ſhall bee, and by powring out our ſoules to God in our prayers, that hee will direct our actions, and bleſſe his owne ordinance, and honour himſelfe in our voluntary ſervice: and then our hearts being thus tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon God aforehand, we ſhalbe the more zealous
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:2455:302"/>
in praying, and the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive in hearing, and the more forward and ready in good duties every way. This rule <hi>Solomon</hi> preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth us,<note place="margin">Ecc. 5.1.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>Keep thy foot when goeſt into the houſe of God,</hi> or (as the other Tranſlation hath it) <hi>Take heed to thy foot:</hi> that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> paraphraſeth the place, <hi>[Conſidera etiam atque eiam, quò tendas, &amp; quem adeas]</hi> Think upon it againe and againe, whither thou art a going, and into whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thou commeſt. Thus hee commandeth, and ſo ſhould wee do. When wee are to appeare before God, at the ſolemne times of his Service; wee ſhould think whither it is that wee go,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:2455:302"/>
who it is that we deale with, what it is that wee are then to do, and how wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive comfort and profit by our doing.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have the duty: our part will bee to think how well we have obſerved it. If wee come to heare without turning our hearts toward God aforehand, wee are not ſo fitted for this work, as we ſhould be. And for want hereof, wee may feare, leſt as the King ſaid to his unmanerly gueſt; <hi>Friend how cameſt thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment? Matt.</hi> 22.12: So God may ſay to us, How is it, that ye come to heavenly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, not having heavenly mindes? and why come ye
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:2455:303"/>
to ſtand before God, when your hearts are turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the world? Theſe things conſidered, my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is, as <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan, 6.10</note> when he prayed, <hi>ſet open his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows towards Ieruſalem,</hi> that he might looke toward that place, where God was, to whom he made his prayer: ſo when wee heare, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any ſervice unto God, that then for the ſharpening of our attention we would ſet open the windowes of our ſoules towards heaven; that while wee are hearing or reading, wee may look toward the place, where our Lord dwelleth, who is now ſpeaking unto us.</p>
                     <p n="4">IIII. The fourth and laſt <hi>preparative</hi> duty is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:2455:303"/>
we come to heare Gods word, we empty our ſoules of all knowen and unlawfull luſts; that ſo our hearts may bee fit receptacles for the word of Chriſt to dwell in. For, if the veſſell be muſty, it will marre the beſt wine, that can be powred into it; and if the ſtomach be filthy, it will corrupt the moſt wholeſome meat; and if the ground bee cumbred with thornes and weeds, it will choake the pureſt ſeed. And ſo, if the ſoule bee defiled with ſinfull luſts, it will choke the ſeed of Gods word, and corrupt this food of the ſoule, and make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the hearers. This S. <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth us, when he ſaith, <hi>Lay apart all

In theſe places, theſe two Apoſtles do teach us two duties, the one <hi>principall</hi> and primarily intended; and that is, that wee receive Gods word with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for eſtabliſhing our ſoules in grace: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>preparative</hi> duty, that muſt go before, and make way for it, and that is, that firſt of all we <hi>lay aſide all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe

and naughtineſſe,</hi> and ſinfull luſts. For more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and clearer underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of which rules, wee may conſider theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Apoſtles words. (1.)

Apoſtles. (2.)

When S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lay apart all ſuperfluities, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; <hi>receive the ingraffed word;</hi> and when S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Laying aſide, &amp;c. deſire the ſincere milk:</hi> both of them meane that as good meat breedeth not good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a corrupt ſtomach; no more doth Gods word nouriſh our ſoules, unleſſe theſe bad humours of ſinne be firſt emptied and purged out. The ſumme of all is, that he who will thrive and grow in grace by the food of the word; muſt firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden himſelf of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of ſinne. And this ſheweth that this emptying
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:2455:307"/>
out of all ſinfull luſts, is a preparative duty neceſſary for them, that will receive good by Gods word.</p>
                     <p>This may ſuffice for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the point: but yet we ſhall more clearely &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly underſtand it, if we conſider what helps and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therances this purging out of ſin will afford him, that cometh to heare Gods word for the profit of his ſoule.

Ioh.</hi> 5.44. Note here, (1.) the unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and indiſpoſition of this people, to beleeve CHRISTS word: <hi>how can ye beleeve?</hi> (2.) the reaſon or cauſe hereof in theſe words, <hi>which receive honour, one of an other.</hi> Hee meaneth that becauſe they were given to vaine glory, and eſteemed the praiſes of men more then the honor that cometh
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:2455:308"/>
from God, therefore they could not beleeve the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which did not onely bring contempt with it, but did teach men willingly to beare it. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that their vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory did ſo blinde their eies, that they could not acknowledge the truth of the word, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. And ſo, by the ſame reaſon, covetouſneſſe blindeth mens eies, that they cannot beleeve any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that is contrary to their profit. And wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes blindeth their eies, that they cannot beleeve that, which is contrary to their luſts. And revenge blindeth the eies, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee that truth, which is contrary
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:2455:309"/>
to their malice. And love of a mans ſelfe and of his own Teachers, doth ſo blind his eies, that he diſcerneth not the plaine truth, that croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his prejudice, and the opinions which his Maſters have inſtilled into him. And in a word, every ſinfull paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as a cloud to darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the underſtanding, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee any truth that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that ſin. And this may be one reaſon, why the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: nor can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.

                     <p n="2">II. This <hi>puritie</hi> of ſoule diſburdened of her ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts, diſpoſeth a man to the obedience of Gods word, and maketh him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and prepared to obſerve and do what is therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Now theſe works
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:2455:312"/>
of obedience, they bee the very fruits &amp; harveſt cropp, for reaping whereof the ſeed of Gods word is ſowen. For the end of our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and reading, is that men may heare; and the end of their hearing is, that they may learne and know Gods will; and the end of their learning &amp; knowledge is that they may do Gods will and keep his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. This gradation of cauſes, is clearly expreſſed by <hi>Moſes Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12. And it is intimated by our Saviour alſo in the Goſpell, when he ſaith, <hi>This peoples heart is waxed groſſe, and their eares are dul of hearing, &amp; their eies they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:2455:313"/>
eies, &amp; heare with their eares, &amp; underſtand with their heart, and ſhould bee converted, and I ſhould heale them. Matt.</hi> 13.15. By theſe ſpeeches it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that Doing is the end of Hearing. Now that which in our hearing doth fit us for this end, is if wee purge our ſoules aforehand of all ſinfull luſts, and yeeld up our ſelves to be moulded by the word. For they that be in love with any luſt, are loth to heare and more loth to do that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to the contrary. <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe hee was in love with his fleſhly luſts, would not hearken to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> when hee tould him of his inceſt:<note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> the Phariſes, becauſe they were in love
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:2455:313"/>
with their money, derided our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.13, 14.</note> when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt covetouſneſſe. And <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 King 22.</note> becauſe hee was reſolved to go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> to battell; put <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> in priſon, for adviſing him to the contrary. And ſo it is ſtill. He that is reſolved to live in oppreſſion, will not care for the Preachers words, when he telleth him of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> threatening, <hi>Let no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the</hi> LORD <hi>is an avenger of all ſuch.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6. And he that is reſolved to go on in his uncleane luſts, will not care, when hee is tould of that ſentence, <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Heb.</hi> 13.4. And
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2455:314"/>
he that is given to his bellie cheare, will ſleight that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat of our Saviour, <hi>Take heed, leſt your hearts bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with ſurfetting &amp; drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, &amp;c. Luk.</hi> 21.34. And generally whoſoever is led with any luſt, untill he be content to part with that luſt, will never bee willing to yeeld obedience to that Scripture, which forbiddeth it. Yea, and they who are zelouſly affected to religion, and performe holy duties with ſome care, yet if they have but any one unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified paſſion behinde; that luſt will make them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the ſhoulder, when they ſhould yeeld obedience to the word. A plaine proof hereof may bee ſeene in the
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:2455:314"/>
rich young man mentioned <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For hee came to CHRIST with great zele, and was reſolved to do any thing that hee might be ſaved: <hi>Good Maſter</hi> (ſaith hee,) <hi>what good thing ſhall I do, &amp;c?</hi> But when our LORD bade him, <hi>Go ſell all that thou haſt, &amp;c: and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven:</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>he was ſad at that ſaying, and went away grieved.</hi> The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that though he were a forward young man, and purpoſed to do any thing, that CHRIST would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him for gaining of eternall life; yet becauſe hee was in love with his wealth, he thought this to bee too hard a condition to
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:2455:315"/>
be accepted of. And ſo it is, and will bee with all other men: if they be in love with any one ſinne, that will not ſuffer them to ſubmit to that word of God, which forbiddeth it. But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he that hath emptied his ſoule of every knowen ſin, is ready for every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, &amp; will ſubmit to whatſoever God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne him. For having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out every luſt, he hath nothing left behind, that may oppoſe GODS word, when it commandeth him his duty. Such a man, if God ſhould command him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his life for religion, as he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſon; he would ſay with S. <hi>Paul, My life is
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:2455:315"/>
not deare unto mee, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy. Act.</hi> 20.24. And if God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire reſtitution of ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goods, hee would ſay with <hi>Zaccheus; If I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any thing from any man by falſe accuſation,</hi> or any other unjuſt dealing, <hi>I will reſtore him fourefold. Luk.</hi> 19.8. And if GOD ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to mortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by hard and auſtere cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements; hee would ſay with S. <hi>Paul, I will keep under my body, and bring it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. And ſo in all other the moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſervices. For what can be too hard for him in Gods commandements, who hath forſaken every thing, that is forbidden by them? Thus
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:2455:316"/>
the purging of the heart from all ſin, maketh a man ready for obedience of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commandement: which is the very crowne and the glory of our hearing.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. This <hi>cleanſing</hi> of the ſoule from all ſinfull luſts, inviteth God to aſſiſt us with grace, and to bleſſe our hearing with ſucceſſe, and to increaſe all his mercies to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards us. <hi>For the ſecret of the Lord is with them that feare him, and he will ſhew them his covenant. Pſal.</hi> 25.14. And, <hi>my ſonne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandements with thee, &amp;c. then ſhalt thou underſtand the feare of the Lord, and finde the knowledge of God. For the Lord giveth
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:2455:316"/>
wiſedome: out of his mouth commeth knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Prov.</hi> 2.1, 5, 6. And of <hi>Cornelius</hi> wee reade, that hee being <hi>a devout man,</hi> and one that <hi>feared God, and gave much almes to the people, and prayed God continually;</hi> God was ſo well pleaſed herewith, that firſt hee ſent an Angel from heaven to direct him what courſe hee ſhould take for ſaving of his ſoule; and then hee ſent <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to tell him thoſe things, by which both hee and his houſhold ſhould bee ſaved: and laſtly, while <hi>Peter</hi> was preaching, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> was hearing, he powred downe the holy Ghoſt upon all them that heard the word. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And ſo it will bee
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:2455:317"/>
with us: if wee bee like to <hi>Cornelius</hi> in devotion, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God in purity of heart; we need not doubt, but God will ſend us ſuch Teachers, as may direct us in the waies of ſalvation, and will grant us the aſſiſtance of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to bleſſe our hearing with an happy ſucceſſe.</p>
                     <p>But on the contrary, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man come to heare Gods word with the conſcience of knowen ſinne, or with any luſt, that lieth unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied within him; ſuch a one provoketh God to blind his eyes, and to curſe his labors. To this purpoſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Say to the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Thus ſaith the Lord God, Repent and turne your ſelves

<pb n="593" facs="tcp:2455:319"/>
ſuffer him to erre, for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to that man, that came to heare with a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſoule. (3.)

Agreeable hereunto is that alſo of the Apoſtle, where hee ſaith of
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:2455:320"/>
Antichriſt, that <hi>his comming ſhould bee after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved:</hi> and that <hi>for this cauſe, God ſhould ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeve a lie, that they all might bee damned, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. By all this we may ſee, that if any man come to heare Gods word, with a cleare conſcience, purged from dead works; God is ever ready to teach and direct that man in the right way to heaven. But if
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:2455:320"/>
any come with a conſcience defiled with knowen ſinne; God forſaketh that man, and leaveth him to falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to bee ſeduced and miſ-led to his ruine.</p>
                     <p>Thus the point is cleared, that he who will heare with profit, muſt firſt empty his ſoule of all ſinfull luſts: the uſes follow.</p>

his hearing, hee have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to empty his heart of earthly thoughts, that ſo hee might bee at leaſure for God; whether he have uſed to ſeaſon his mind with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly thoughts at home, that hee might be attentive in Gods ſervice; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by due examination of his wayes, hee have ſought to caſt out all unlawfull luſts out of his ſoule; or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee have not rather bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied his mind with thoughts of the world, when he was come before God, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in his word; or, whether hee have not gone into Gods houſe, without thinking whither he was a going; or finally, whether he have not caried ſome ſin
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:2455:321"/>
with him into the Church, which no perſwaſions of the Preacher could make him to forſake. Thoſe that have prepared themſelves before hand, may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with this thought, that the good ſeede hath been ſowen in good ground and therefore will bring forth fruit to eternall life. But if we conſider how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fruit of obedience there appeareth in the world, we may well think, that moſt men have uſed but ſmall preparation before their hearing. And therefore now it is high time, to beginne this ſo neceſſary a work, that their negligence do not make their labors fruitleſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Seeing the heart is
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:2455:322"/>
not fit for the ſeed of Gods word, till the rubbiſh bee weeded out, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of ſinne purged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; it ſtandeth us upon, to ſearch every corner of our ſoules, leſt ſome luſt lie lurking there, which wee have not diſcovered, nor have had care to expell. For every ſuch luſt is a ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of naughtineſſe, which hindreth our growing by the word. For example, if there bee a luſt of adultery and uncleanneſſe, that is a ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe: purge out this, or elſe, it will hinder your growth in grace. And if there be a luſt of pride and vaineglory, that is a ſuperfluity, which muſt bee purged out, or elſe
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:2455:322"/>
the word will not enter in. And ſo I may ſay of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and of malice, and of revenge, and of every evill luſt: they be ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of naughtineſſe: and if they be ſuffered to harbour in the ſoule, they will ſhut the doore againſt all good inſtructions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. There is hence encouragement and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for all true hearted Chriſtians, becauſe having purged out their luſts, and reſolving to do what God ſhall command, they are rightly qualified for hearing of Gods word. If any thing be neceſſary to be knowen, which is too hard for their underſtanding, Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, that he will reveile
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:2455:323"/>
it unto them, and leade them in the right way. Our Saviour hath ſaid, <hi>If any man will do Gods will, hee ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it bee of God, or no. Ioh.</hi> 7.17. Where (1.) when he ſaith, <hi>If any man will do Gods will,</hi> he meaneth, if hee be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to performe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand him. And (2.) when hee ſaith of ſuch a man, that <hi>he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it bee of God,</hi> he meaneth, he ſhall bee guided to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the maine points of faith, even ſo much as may ſerve to ſave his ſoule. For firſt, the eie of his ſoule is cleare from miſts and foggs of paſſion; by reaſon whereof hee will diſcerne
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:2455:323"/>
thoſe truths, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And ſecondly, if any thing be too high for his apprehenſion, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veile that unto him by one meanes or other, rather then ſo faithfull a ſervant of his ſhould erre from the right way, that leadeth to eternall life. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he that doth ſettle his heart in a ſincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to do what God ſhall enjoyne him in his word; may bee confident in this hope, that he ſhall not erre with danger to his ſoule. A great comfort this may bee to a true Chriſtian in theſe wrangling times, and dayes of contention, wherein va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of queſtions doth
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:2455:324"/>
much diſtract the minds of many men. My concluſion is this, when we go to heare Gods word preached, or take a Bible into our hands to reade; let us abandon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very knowen ſinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to ſerve God in every knowen duty: and then our comfort is, we ſhall <hi>know the truth, and the truth ſhall make us free.</hi>

And they, as I conceive of them at this time, are three. (1.) Attention to the things, which are ſpoken: (2.) Reverence to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſpeaketh: and (3.) wiſdome in fitting all to our owne uſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The firſt is <hi>Attention.</hi>
                        <pb n="604" facs="tcp:2455:325"/>
And that (as<note n="*" place="margin">Nigron. de exhor. domeſt. cap. 5. nu. 15. p. 89.</note> one defineth it, not unfitly,) is <hi>[ſeria &amp; diligens animi applicatio ad ea, quae dicuntur] a ſerious applying of the minde to the things, that are ſaid:</hi> or, it is, when we bend the mind and underſtanding to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and mark that which is ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this dutie there are two things to bee declared. (1.) What uſe and neceſſitie there is of it in our hearing: and (2.) what meanes wee may uſe for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">[I.] What uſe there is of it. And the anſwere is, the uſes of it are three eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Attention</hi> is that which doth <hi>enlive</hi> our hearing, and
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:2455:325"/>
maketh it effectuall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. For if we heare, and attend not, we do not learn by the inſtructions that ſhould teach us; we are not moved by the exhortations that ſhould perſwade us to well-doing; nor are we fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the threatnings that ſhould deterre us from ſin. In ſumme, whatſoever is ſaid to do us good, is as water ſpilt upon the ground, that cannot be taken up for any uſe. But Attention in hearing, is like the plough that goeth before the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For as the plough ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ground that the ſeed may enter in, and take root under the furrows: ſo attention ſetteth open the heart that it may receive the
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:2455:326"/>
word in, when it is ſpoken by the Preacher. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Scriptures do deſcribe diligent &amp; zelous Hearers, they ſet them out by their attentivenes to the word ſpoken. Thus it is ſaid of the people in <hi>Nehe.</hi> time, that <hi>the eares of all the people were attentive unto the booke of the Law,</hi> when it was read unto them. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.3. And ſo of the people in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours time, it is ſaid, that they <hi>were very attentive to heare him;</hi> or, (as the other Tranſlation hath it,) they <hi>hanged upon him, when they heard him. Luk.</hi> 19.48. The meaning is,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> their mindes did hang upon his lips, to ſuck-in his doctrine, as the childe hangeth upon the
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:2455:326"/>
dugs, that hee may ſuck in his mothers milk. Whence wee are further advertiſed, that as children, who follow the dug, do thrive and grow by the milk; ſo the hearer, that is atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tive to the word, doth grow and thrive by it. But without attention, as our prayers are a lip-labour, which God reſpecteth not; and for which he reproveth the Jews, <hi>This people draweth neere unto mee, with their mouth, and honoreth mee with their lips, but their hearts are farre from me: Matt.</hi> 15.8: ſo without attention, our hearing is an ear-labour, of which God may ſay by the ſame reaſon, This people draw neere unto mee with their eares, but their heart
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:2455:327"/>
is farre from mee. Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe it maketh our hearing profitable &amp; availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Attention</hi> to GODS word, maketh God willing and ready to inſtruct us, and lead us by his grace. For as we uſe to ſay of wiſe men, that they ſtrike, while the yron is hot; becauſe then it will yeeld to the hammer, and may eaſily be facioned, as the workman will: ſo God dealeth with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; when they are ready &amp; rightly diſpoſed for his bleſſings, then hee uſeth to beſtow them. <hi>Open thy mouth wide,</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>and I will fill it. Pſal.</hi> 81.10. So, if men open their hearts, &amp;
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:2455:327"/>
bee ready to receive, then God openeth his hand, and powreth in his bleſſings. But if men ſhut their mouths, when they ſhould receive, God will ſhut his hand, when hee ſhould give. And there is great reaſon for it. For a wiſe houſeholder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not have his wine ſpilt, therefore will not powre it upon the veſſel, when the mouth is ſtopped. And ſo our wiſe God, be-becauſe hee would not have his graces loſt, will not beſtow them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when men are not fit to receive them. This point is clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the example of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel:</hi> When God called, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, Samuel,</hi> once and again and the third time; he ſtill
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:2455:328"/>
                        <hi>went to Eli,</hi> to know what he would have. And all this while God ſaid nothing to <hi>Samuel,</hi> of the meſſage that he intended for him. But at laſt, when God called, as at other times, <hi>Samuel, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel;</hi> then <hi>Samuel,</hi> turned himſelfe toward God and <hi>ſaid, Speak Lord, for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant heareth.</hi> And then God reveiled himſelfe unto him by his word, and inſtructed him in his will. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.10. And ſo, if our mindes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der abroad, and talk with the vanities of the world, while GOD ſpeaketh unto us in his word preached or read: it is no marvell, if he take his word from us, and give it to them, that are better diſpoſed for it. Or, if
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:2455:328"/>
he ſuffer his word to remain with us, yet hee may denie his grace, that might make it profitable unto us. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention then is neceſſary in this reſpect alſo, becauſe it moveth God to teach and direct us in the right way.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Attention</hi> is an act of the minde, by which wee witneſſe our due reſpect to GOD and his word. <hi>Iob</hi> deſcribing the account, that men made of him in his proſperitie, ſaith, <hi>To mee men gave care, and waited, and kept ſilence at my counſell. Iob</hi> 29.21. And on the contrary, it is a great indignitie to a man, if while he is talking with us, wee turne our backs upon him, and looke an other way.
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:2455:329"/>
A man of place or facion would take it in ill part to be ſo neglected by us. But the indignity is much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if when the Lord of heaven ſpeaketh unto us, about the weightie affaires of our ſalvation, wee turne from him, and talk with the vanities of the world. Such behaviour is not fit for Gods preſence, nor can we think to pleaſe him, when wee neglect him ſo much. It is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that the LORD <hi>opened her heart, that ſhe attended to the things, which were ſpoken of Paul. Act.</hi> 16.14. Which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that if wee attend not, when God ſpeaketh to us in his word, it is becauſe our hearts are ſhut againſt God
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:2455:329"/>
and we denie him entrance and entertainment: but if God by his grace have once opened our hearts, then we with attention will hearken to his word. Again we read, that Gods delight is in ſuch men, as do heare his word with an awfull reverence &amp; dutifull reſpect. Thus ſaith the LORD, <hi>The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footſtoole, &amp;c. for all thoſe things hath mine hand made; and all thoſe things have been, ſaith the Lord. But to this man will I looke, even to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my word. Iſ.</hi> 66.1, 2. Which is, as if hee ſhould ſay, Heaven &amp; earth and all the world are mine; and I may be where &amp; with

whom I will: but hee that trembleth or ſtandeth in aw of my word, is the man that I have made choiſe of, and that I delight to dwell with. But if any bee careleſſe and unreſpective of God, when he ſpeaketh unto him; that man as hee neglecteth God, ſo is he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected of him. The ſumme is, Attention to the word ſpoken, is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that wee may ſhew a due and dutifull reſpect to God, whoſe word it is.</p>
                     <p n="2">[II.] This may ſerve to ſhew the uſe of this dutie: the next enquiry is to ſeek for ſuch helps, as may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us in the performance of it. And ſure, this is a point of great moment, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:2455:331"/>
thy of our beſt care. For, how ever attention bee ſo neceſſary for right hearing, nor will any of us deny the profitable uſe of it: yet ſuch is our frailty and folly, that uſually our thoughts wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the world over, while wee are in Gods preſence, and ſhould heare his word, which is <hi>able to ſave our ſoules.</hi> For ſometimes, wee do willingly buſie our ſelves with earthly thoughts about our Trades, and our Lands, and our houſhold affaires, and other things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And ſometimes, as the devill ſtood at <hi>Ioſhuahs</hi> right hand to reſiſt him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1: ſo hee ſtandeth at our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and caſteth worldly thoughts into our mindes,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:2455:332"/>
or heavineſſe of ſleepe into our heads, or diſeſteeme of the word ſpoken, into our hearts. And at all times, ſuch is the frailty of the fleſh, and our daily acquaintance with the things of this world; that though we ſtrive to be attentive, yet by-thoughts will creepe in, and diſtract our mindes, while wee are about that good work. By reaſon whereof, it will bee hard to drive away idle thoughts, and impoſſible to be altogether without them. And therefore, it will bee a labour well beſtowed, if by enquiry wee can finde out ſome ſuch helpes, as may ſerve to heale our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to keepe us ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in this duty. For which
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:2455:332"/>
purpoſe, I have thought on ſome rules; they that are experienced in aſceticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, may perhaps adde more, and finde better; and they ſhall do well to further us with their ſtore. The rules that at this preſent I have in readineſſe, are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Rule.</hi> It will bee good, to accuſtome our ſelves to the dayly reading of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and frequent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on heavenly things. For if the minde bee throughly ſeaſoned with ſuch thoughts, it will not be ſo ready to admit of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and fanſies; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the readieſt for our thoughts, with which wee are moſt familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For proofe of this,
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:2455:333"/>
let us aſk our owne hearts and they will tell us, that if a man have beene buſied in ſcraping and heaping up riches, his minde while hee is in the Church, will runne upon his baggs, and bonds, and his accounts, and other ſuch meanes of thriving in the world; and if a man bee given to dalliance and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts; his mind will runne upon his Minion, and the works of fleſhly delights: and if a man be ſet on ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſire of high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; his minde will runne on the meanes of riſing, and of great offices, and places of preferment.

And when ſuch things are mentioned and talked of, he wil as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as attentively both heare and obſerve them, as a worldly minded man will heare and ſpeak of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, or an effeminate man of his pleaſures, or an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man of his honours. And as a worldly man, when he is about his purchaſes and bargains, goeth ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to work, and is not eaſily diverted from the buſineſſe that hee is about; ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:2455:334"/>
minded man, if hee bee as heartily religious, as the other is covetous, will bee ſo ſerious and attentive in matters of Gods ſervice, that other by-thoughts will not eaſily divert or turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his minde. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if worldly thoughts do much diſturbe our hearing, it is an argument that the ſtudie of the world is more frequent with us, and more delightfull to us, then the ſtudie of Gods word. For redreſſing of which errour, and to keepe our mindes from evagations and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; our care muſt be, to place our ſtudie on Gods word, and thereby to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our mindes with a love of heavenly things, and a
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:2455:334"/>
ſerious care of our ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It will be an helpe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if we uſe ſuch poſture of body, as may be apt to keep our ſenſes waking, and to drive away heavines &amp; ſleep. How this is to be done, we may take direction from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of former times. Firſt then wee read in the Goſpel, that when our Lord had read his Text, and was ready to ſpeak unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>the eies of all them that were in the Synagogue, were faſtened upon him. Luk.</hi> 4.20. Which words, as they ſhew with what attention they prepared to heare the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; ſo they intimate, that by this means they were likely to continue their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as the mind ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

out the eies, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which it ſelfe liketh; ſo the eies, if they bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened on an object, do ſtirre up the minde to think on that thing, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to its view. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as gazing abroad diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the minde with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of objects; ſo the faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them on the ſpeaker, doth ſettle the mind, where the eies are fixed. And by reaſon hereof, it will bee ſome help to ſharpen our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, if ſometimes, &amp; as occaſion requireth, wee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten our eies upon the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers face, &amp; look that way, where we deſire our minds to be. Againe, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the wicked man, that <hi>he ſhutteth his eies to deviſe fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

He meaneth, that as men, when they are in ſerious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do ſhut the eies, that nothing may diſtract their minds; ſo the wicked man ſhutteth his eies, that hee with more intention may deviſe miſchief. And ſo in this work of hearing, it may ſometimes be an help to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, if wee look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or cover the eies; that the minde having no diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from without, may be the more intent on his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent buſineſſe. Thirdly, wee read of the ancient Monks in Egypt: (And the name of <hi>Monks,</hi> was then as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for their devotion, as now it is growen contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible for the ſuperſtition

                     <p n="3">3. It will bee an other help, if we labour to remove all <hi>lets and impediments,</hi> that uſe to diſturb us. <hi>Solomons</hi> rule is, <hi>It is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes ſtrong drink: leſt they drink, &amp; forget the Law, &amp; pervert the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any of the afflicted. Prov.</hi> 31.4, 5. He meaneth that drinking of wine, and ſtrong drink might make them unfit for judicature, &amp; doing of Juſtice: &amp; in ſuch a caſe even Kings were bound to avoid it; leſt it ſhould diſable them for the doing of their duties. And this
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:2455:337"/>
rule bindeth us alſo to avoid ſuch things, as may hinder us in Gods ſervice. If wee drink wine &amp; ſtrong drink, that is apt to fume into the head and to procure drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe and ſleepe; if we eat a full meale, that calleth the ſpirits to the ſtomach for concoction, and in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, the braine is diſabled for contemplation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious thoughts; and if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to Church, we drowne our ſelves in meriments and ſports, that will ſeaſon the minde with carnall delights, and make the ſoule unfit to reliſh the things of the Spirit: and if any man ſtuff his mind with worldly eares, and buſineſſes of this life; that will leave
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:2455:337"/>
no roome for ſpirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to enter in. And if any of us do finde, that by theſe or any other ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions we be hindered in our hearing; wee muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare drinking of wine, and feeding to the full, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in carnall ſports, &amp; cumbring our ſelves with worldly cares, and what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe may breed either drowſineſſe or diſtraction. Elſe, it will bee impoſſible, that wee ſhould heare with attention, and as impoſſible that we ſhould profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It will bee an help to our hearing, if while wee are about that work, we do ever and anone reflect upon our ſelves, and conſider
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:2455:338"/>
what thoughts doe then lodge within us. And if we finde diſtractions to divert us, we ſhould blame our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward hearts, bewaile our corruptions, and recall the minde to his buſineſſe again. This will help us againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, becauſe our heart will learne by often checks, to bee the more watchfull; and we by condemning our ſelves for our neglect of God and our own good, ſhall be made the more warie of offending any more: even as a traveller, that hath miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his way through heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſenes, will bee the more carefull afterward to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve every turning, and to avoid every by-waie, that might miſlead him.</p>

                     <p n="2">II. The next vertue to be exerciſed in the time of our hearing, is due <hi>reverence</hi> to God and his holy word. <hi>Solomon</hi> requireth it of us in our prayers and praiſes of God: <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou goeſt to the houſe of God, bee not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſtie to utter any thing before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth; therefore, let thy words be few. Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1, 2. Wee may note in this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence two things, a rule and
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:2455:339"/>
a reaſon. (1.) A <hi>Rule,</hi> &amp; that is expreſſed two waies: 1. negatively in theſe words. <hi>Be not raſh, &amp;c.</hi> He meaneth that we ſhould not preſume to ſpeak unto God, but with premeditation and adviſed ſoberneſſe. 2. Affirmatively, in thoſe words, <hi>Let thy words be few.</hi> He meaneth that our words ſhould be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then they will not be many: &amp; that our ſpeech ſhould bee ſparing; ſuch, as may argue modeſtie and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, rather then too much familiaritie and boldneſſe. This is the Rule. (2.) The <hi>reaſon</hi> hereof given in the Text, is; <hi>For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth.</hi> Hee meaneth that there is as much diſtance between him
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:2455:339"/>
and us men, as is betweene heaven and earth: and that as farre as heaven is higher then the earth, ſo farre, and more alſo, is Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe above our meaneneſſe and low condition. And therefore, as when we come before an earthly King, we are wary and obſervant, leſt any word ſhould fall from us, that beſeemeth not his preſence: ſo, and much more carefull ſhould we be, when wee come before the King of Heaven, leſt any word may ſlip from us, not beſeeming his greatnes. This <hi>Solomon</hi> requireth of us, when we come to ſpeak to God, in our praiers, or praiſes of his name: and the ſame reaſon holdeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:2455:340"/>
the ſame rule ſhould be obſerved, when wee come to heare God ſpeaking to us in his word. Wee muſt not be raſh and bolde, and over-familiar with our LORD and Maſter: but heare with reverence, when hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth unto us; and tremble at his word, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us, and laieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us a charge of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And the reaſon is good: <hi>for God is in heaven, and wee are upon earth;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ſhould learne to keep diſtance, and never appeare before him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tokens of ſubmiſſion and reverence.</p>
                     <p>Now this reverence may bee ſeene and obſerved in three things; (1.) in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:2455:340"/>
eſteeme of God and his word, (2.) in a dutifull behaviour, while we are in his preſence: and (3.) in a modeſt quietneſſe &amp; ſilence, while he is ſpeaking unto us.</p>
                     <p n="1">[I.] In a <hi>reverend eſteeme</hi> of God and his word; when we ſo think of them, and the place where they are preſent, as beſeemeth his greatneſſe, and their worth and dignitie. And this duty wee ſhall performe, if wee obſerve two rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) That we conceive of God as of the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, whoſe glory ſo farre ſurpaſſeth not onely our meane condition, but our ſhallow apprehenſion, as that we are no more able to abide his preſence, then a
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:2455:341"/>
weak eie is able to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſunne in his ſtrength. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth God to bee <hi>the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and onely Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords: who onely hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and dwelleth in the light, which no man can approch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; whom no man hath ſeene, nor can ſee.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15, 16. In theſe words the glory of our Lord is ſet out by three things: (1.) By his owne greatneſſe; <hi>He is a Potentate, a King, and a Lord, that hath immortality and light:</hi> (2.) By a compariſon with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Ones; <hi>He is the only Potentat, the king of kings and Lord of lords:</hi> (3.) By his ſurpaſſing glory farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all conceit, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:2455:341"/>
of men; <hi>He dwelleth in the light that no man can approch unto; no man hath ſeene him, nor can ſee him.</hi> Thus every word doth ſome way ſet out his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glory; which being conſidered accordingly will breed an awfull eſteeme thereof, and a trembling before him. And from hence it is, that the <hi>Seraphims did cover their faces,</hi> when hee appeared unto them; and <hi>the poſts of the doore mooved,</hi> when hee ſpake; and the Prophet cried out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone; becauſe I am a man of uncleane lips, and mine eyes have ſeene the King, the Lord of hoſts. Iſai.</hi> 6.2, 4. And for the ſame reaſon, when <hi>Moſes</hi> (like the ſons
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:2455:342"/>
of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> not knowing what hee aſked) deſired to <hi>ſee Gods glory;</hi> hee was told that <hi>no man could ſee Gods face, and live.</hi> Gods <hi>back-parts</hi> hee was vouchſafed to ſee, that is, ſome ſmall luſter of his glory: and yet then, hee had need to bee put to the <hi>clift of a rock,</hi> and to be <hi>covered with Gods hand,</hi> leſt the glory of the LORD ſhould overcome him with its luſter. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from the ſame ground it is, that the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, after they had heard the voice of God ſpeaking unto them in mount Sina; they were amazed and ſaid, <hi>If wee heare the voice of the Lord our God any more, wee ſhall die. For who is there of
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:2455:342"/>
all fleſh, that hath heard the voice of the living God, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the midſt of the fire, as we have, and lived? Deut.</hi> 5.25. Thus the Angels, and the Prophets, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have beene affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if God at any time have manifeſted himſelfe to them in glory. And thus, and in this maner we ſhould think of God, when hee ſpeaketh to us in his word; and alwaies cary a reverend awe towards his Majeſty, whenſoever wee are before him. So <hi>Iacob</hi> did; when God had reveiled himſelfe unto him in a viſion by night, and he was now awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of his ſleepe, hee ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. And
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:2455:343"/>
hee was afraid</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and ſaid, How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is this place? This is no other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heaven. Gen.</hi> 28.16, 17. Note in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. (1.) How <hi>Iacob</hi> was affected at Gods preſence, <hi>He was afraid,</hi> meaning, that he was ſtruck with an awfull conceit of Gods Majeſtie, in whoſe preſence he was. And ſo ſhould we be: when we come into Gods preſence, and heare him uttering the wonderfull things of his Law, wee ſhould in all aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reverence, humble our ſelves before him. (2.) Note what <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods preſence. Firſt hee ſaid, <hi>God is in this place;</hi> hee meant, that God
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:2455:343"/>
by appearing and reveiling himſelfe to his ſervant, did ſhew himſelfe to bee there preſent, though <hi>Iacob</hi> never thought of any ſuch thing. And ſo, when God pleaſeth to reveile himſelfe unto us by his word, though wee do not ſee or diſcerne it with our bodily eies; yet wee muſt know that God is there preſent, becauſe he reveileth himſelfe. Secondly, <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid. <hi>How dreadful is this place? This is no other but the houſe of God, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is, that becauſe God ſhewed himſelfe by his viſions in this place; therefore the place was to bee eſteemed as Gods houſe, even as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelfe, in which it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to dwell. And ſo,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:2455:344"/>
when wee come into the Church, the place where God doth ſpeak with us, and hath promiſed his preſence; we ſhould eſteeme that, as Gods houſe where he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and as <hi>the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> which is the place of his habitation. Thus wee ſhould think of God and his preſence, when he ſpeaketh unto us out of his word. And that is the firſt rule to be obſerved by us, for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our reverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) That wee eſteeme the word ſpoken by Gods Miniſter out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the very word of the Almighty God. This S. <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth in the Theſſalonians: <hi>For this cauſe</hi>
                        <pb n="641" facs="tcp:2455:344"/>
(ſaith he) <hi>we thank God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, becauſe when yee received the word of God, which yee heard of us; yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.13. Here are two things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: (1.) Who it was that ſpake and delivered this word, and that was <hi>Paul,</hi> a man like unto themſelves: and (2.) Whoſe word they eſteemed it to be; not <hi>Pauls,</hi> nor any other mans, but Gods alone. And there was great reaſon for it. For if the King ſhould ſend an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, with commiſſion to proclaime his will to his people; no man would ſay, that this meſſage were the will or word of the Officer,
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:2455:345"/>
who proclaimed it, but the will of the King, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it. And ſo theſe Theſſalonians did rightly eſteeme the word preached, <hi>as Gods word,</hi> from whom it was ſent, and not as <hi>Pauls</hi> word, by whom it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for ſo doing, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rightly diſtinguiſhed betweene God and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: ſo it will bee our praiſe, if when wee heare Gods word, delivered by a mortall man, yet wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it as the word of the immortall and ever bleſſed God. A good rule then it is, that wee eſteeme the word ſpoken by the Miniſter, as the word ſent from the Lord Almighty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="643" facs="tcp:2455:345"/>Theſe rules, if they bee duly obſerved, will further us diverſe waies to the right hearing of Gods word with profit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They will work in us <hi>attentiveneſſe,</hi> to mark all that is ſpoken. For even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, if the Speaker be had in honour, his words will be received with heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and attention. It is ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> that <hi>all the people gave heed to him from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſaying, This man is the great power of God: and to him they had regard, becauſe that of long time hee had bewitched them with ſorceries. Act.</hi> 8.10. Conſider here: (1.) how this people were affected to <hi>Simon Magus, They gave heed
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:2455:346"/>
unto him,</hi> and <hi>regarded him:</hi> (2.) why they thus obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and reſpected him, and that was, becauſe hee had <hi>bewitched them,</hi> to beleeve that he was <hi>the great power of God,</hi> or one whom God had endued with great abilities from heaven. The like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we may find in our owne experience. For if we think highly of any mans vertues, and eſteeme his words to have weight and worth in them: we heare them with attention, &amp; embrace them as Oracles of great worth. And ſo, in this caſe, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſeſteeme of God and his word, that maketh men to neglect the word, when it is preached in their hearing. And therefore as
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:2455:346"/>
                        <hi>Rabſakeh</hi> ſaid, <hi>Heare yee the words of the great King, the King of Aſſyria. Iſa.</hi> 36.13. meaning, that becauſe hee was a great King, therefore they ſhould give good audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his word: ſo, if wee conſider that it is <hi>the great King,</hi> even the King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſpeaketh unto us; it will command our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make us heare with heed and obſervation. Let this then bee taken for a firſt benefit, that a due e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of God and his word, will cauſe attention in our hearing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A due eſteeme of God and his word, will make us willing to heare our faults reprooved, with <hi>ſubmiſsion and patience.</hi> Old <hi>Eli</hi> is an
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:2455:347"/>
example hereof. For when <hi>Samuel</hi> told him of his ſinne in cockering of his ſonnes, and of the judgement of God threatned againſt him for the ſame; he anſwered, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam</hi> 3.18. Wee may here obſerve, (1.) <hi>Eli</hi> his willing ſubmiſſion to the reprehenſion of <hi>Samuel, Let him do what ſeemeth him good:</hi> and (2.) the reaſon, that made him ſo tractable and obedient, and that was, becauſe <hi>it was the Lord</hi> who had ſent that meſſage. And ſo, if when wee come to heare a Sermon, we conſider that it is God, who ſpeaketh unto us by the mouth of a man, this will cauſe us with patience to heare our ſinnes
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:2455:347"/>
reprooved, and our ſelves cenſured for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion will make us to yeeld a ready <hi>obedience</hi> to the word, and to ſuffer our ſelves to be <hi>moulded</hi> and framed by it, when it preſcribeth us a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee done. This is ſo reaſonable, that <hi>Balaam</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne minde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it to bee right; <hi>Muſt I not take heed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſpeake that which the Lord hath put into my mouth? Num.</hi> 23.12. And ſo, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it is God who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, it will cauſe us to think our ſelves bound to do, what hee ſaith. For no Chriſtian is ſo ſhameleſſe, that will ſay, that hee will not do, what God doth command.
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:2455:348"/>
And therefore wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to obey, they will rather denie that it is Gods word that is brought unto them, then that it is their duty to obey his word. So the Jewes did; when <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> at their requeſt had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of God for them, and told them in Gods Name, that they ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in their owne Land, and not go into Egypt; they being reſolved that it was more expedient for them, to go then to ſtay, told <hi>Ieremy</hi> to his face, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the Lord our God hath not ſent thee to ſay, Go not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, to ſojourne there. Ier.</hi> 43.2. And ſo among us, no man that profeſſeth to
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:2455:348"/>
ſerve the true GOD, will plainely denie ſubmiſſion to his word. The ſumme of all is, that if we bring with us, a due reſpect to God and his word, it will make us atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when wee heare; and <hi>patient,</hi> when we are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and <hi>obedient</hi> when we are commanded that which is our duty to do.</p>
                     <p n="2">[II.] The next thing, in which we are to ſhew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the time of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is a <hi>dutifull behaviour</hi> in the outward man. For even among men, if boies plaie the boies among their fellows, that is, if they bee waggiſh and bolde and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous before their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals; no man will greatly regard it. But if they ſhould
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:2455:349"/>
do ſo before their Maſters face, it were irreverence and rudeneſſe not to bee borne with. And we our ſelves in our owne houſes, where we are among our equals and friends, may uſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie both of ſpeech and behaviour; which would ſavour of contempt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, if it were uſed in the preſence of a Noble man, or of a Counſellor, or of a Prince. And ſo when we come into GODS pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; more ſoberneſſe, and more modeſt and awfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour will be required of us, then is neceſſary, when we are at home, or abroad among our neighbours. And therefore when wee come to heare God ſpeaking unto
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:2455:349"/>
us; wee muſt have a care, that wee do not by our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, bewray an undutifull reſpect to God or his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                     <p>For better obſerving of which duty, I ſhall point at ſome ſuch rules, as I find to have beene either required or obſerved amongſt Gods people: that out of them every man may ſelect ſuch directions, as may bee uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and expedient for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Firſt then, I finde in Gods book, that when God appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> being now to reveile his Law unto him, he firſt of all comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, <hi>Draw not nigh hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; put off thy ſhooes from off thy feet: for the place

whereon thou ſtandeſt, is holy ground. Exod.</hi> 3.5. And ſo the Angell, that appeared to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſuppoſed to be Chriſt the ſecond perſon in the Trinitie, commanded him; <hi>Looſe thy ſhooe from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt, is holy.

                        <hi>frame them to humilitie and an awfull feare.</hi> For as wee pull off the glove, when we ſalute our friends and take them by the hand, in token of our obſervance toward them; and as countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſervants, who go in pattons in the ſtreet, do in good maners put them off, when they come into a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens houſe of any note: ſo in thoſe eaſterne countreys, where <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſhua</hi> dwelt, they were uſed to <hi>put off their ſhooes,</hi> in token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and reſpect, when they came into place, where their betters were. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when GOD ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Put off thy ſhooes,</hi> he meant to teach him his duty towards his LORD; as we,
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:2455:351"/>
when we bid a Child <hi>put off his hat,</hi> &amp; <hi>make a legg,</hi> do meane to teach him good maners towards his betters. (2.) We may conſider in the Text, what the reaſon was, why this outward cariage was required at this time, and in this place: and that was, becauſe the place was <hi>holy ground.</hi> But why were theſe places where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> ſtood, more holy, then any other places in the countrey; eſpecially ſeeing the one of them was in the deſert, an untilled and ill ordered ground, and the other a place by Jericho, at that time a profane city of heatheniſh and idolatrous people? To this queſtion the anſwer is, that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:2455:351"/>
reaſon hereof was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God appeared there, and ſhewed tokens of his preſence. And hence wee have this obſervation, that whereſoever God is in any peculiar ſort preſent, there the <hi>place</hi> is made <hi>holy</hi> by his preſence; and where God doth ſo ſanctifie a place, there we ought to declare our humilitie and dutifull reſpect by externall geſtures of reverence, and by decent behaviour and carriage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I finde, that when God was to appeare on mount Sina, there to deliver the Law to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he firſt commanded to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them, and that they ſhould <hi>waſh their clothes. Exod.</hi> 19.10. The meaning
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:2455:352"/>
of which ceremonie was, partly to admoniſh them of the purity of heart, required when wee come into Gods preſence: &amp; partly to teach them, that they ought to come decently &amp; in a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maner, leſt they might ſhew neglect of his preſence, if they came in a ſluttiſh or unſemely ſort. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when he was to go before <hi>Pharaoh, ſhaved himſelfe, and put on other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell:</hi> ſo wee ought to come into Gods preſence in grave and comely attire, which may beſeeme godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither rudely like clownes, nor finically like wantons. A note not unfit to bee thought on by our ſober maidens, who come
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:2455:352"/>
both into Gods houſe, and unto Gods board, with bare breaſts and naked armes and long locks, and ſuch looſe behaviour, as either beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Ruffians alone, or no Chriſtian at all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I read of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vita Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. l. 4. cap. 33. pag. 400.</note> that being preſent in the Church, when <hi>Euſebius</hi> preached, he ſtood up all the while: and though hee were once and again intreated to ſit down; he ſtill refuſed it. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof was, becauſe as himſelfe ſaid, [<hi>Nefas eſt, inſtitutis de Deo diſputationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, negligentes aures prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere.] It is not lawfull, when things concerning GOD are in handling, to be negligent in hearing.</hi> And the like cuſtom
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:2455:353"/>
do I finde to have beene uſed by many others in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time: but neither was it obſerved generally by all, nor do I require it as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, of any. Onely thus much I obſerve, that holy and devout men, have been zelous to ſhew reverence in Gods ſervice, by every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour that fitted the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, I finde in ſome of the Learned, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe rules of decency in the time of divine ſervice, that they will not permit men, when they are hearing of Gods word to <hi>ſmile</hi> in ſecret, or to <hi>looke about,</hi> or to <hi>laie one legg over an</hi> other, or to <hi>whiſper in their fellows eare,</hi> or to <hi>look ſowre,</hi> as if
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:2455:353"/>
ſomewhat diſpleaſed them, or to <hi>leane and lie on one ſide,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Nigron. in Reg. commun. 2. nu. 57. pag. 167.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſurely even in theſe leſſer things, there is a decencie to be uſed in our outward carriage; at leſt ſo farre, as that nothing appeare, which may bewray either diſlike of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or diſeſteeme of God and his word. And hence we have two leſſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A reproof for them, who allow no outward ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies or religious ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in Gods ſervice, leſt they ſhould be ſuperſtitious and Popiſh. There be men, that dare not <hi>kneele,</hi> when they receive the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor <hi>put off the hat,</hi> when they paſſe through a Church, nor kneele downe
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:2455:354"/>
and make a <hi>privat prayer</hi> in a publik place: ſo that as the ancient worthies, upon all occaſions expreſſed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion by outward geſtures of reverence; ſo theſe men take care, to ſhew how they deteſt ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by avoyding all helps and expreſſions of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wee have hence a ground of exhortation for our ſelves: &amp; it is this, that according to the rules of Scripture, which require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the outward man; &amp; after the example of holy &amp; godly men, who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe rules with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and zele: we alſo, (as occaſion ſhall bee offered) would ſhew our eſteeme of
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:2455:354"/>
God and his word by ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaviour, and geſtures of reverence and humility. Where notwithſtanding, I will preſſe no mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with a neceſſity of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very expreſſion uſed by the Ancients: becauſe for the moſt part they are not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary; but to be uſed with a kinde of freedome, and as occaſion and reaſon ſhall require. Onely thus much I may boldly ſay, and (as I ſuppoſe) with the good leave of all that are well in their wits; that looke what modeſtie and ſignes of reverence we would uſe before a temporall Lord or Prince: ſo much at leaſt is due to him who is <hi>King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords.</hi> And
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:2455:355"/>
if any will ſhew but a like reverence to God, that he would ſhew to his Prince, I will think him more devout, then moſt men among us are at this day.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third and laſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which wee ought to ſhew reverence, is an awfull <hi>quietneſſe and ſilence:</hi> which is, when neither by words nor deeds, we either trouble the preſence, or hinder the work in hand. For by ſuch behaviour as this, men uſe to ſhew their reſpect to their Betters. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, while hee was in proſperity; <hi>The young men did ſee me, and hid themſelves; the aged roſe and ſtood up. The Princes refrained talking, and laid their hands on their
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:2455:355"/>
mouth. The Nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roofe of their mouth. Iob.</hi> 29.8, 9. And each man of diſcretion, if hee bee before them, whom he honoureth, will bee ſparing of his ſpeech, unleſſe either the command of his Superiour, or the preſent occaſion do require it. And ſtill in the preſence of his Betters, he is carefull leſt by hard tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or lowd ſpeaking, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noiſe making, he ſhould breed diſturbance, or ſeeme to neglect them. This, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inſtructeth men to do in their converſing among men: and much more to do the like in holy Aſſemblies, where they have to deale with God. The Turks out of

When the name of God was ſpoken, they fell upon their faces, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ground.</hi> And in a

no man ſeemed to bee preſent, and more eſpecially in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding prayer, in which no man did ſpit, or hawk, or cough, or gape, or yawne,</hi> as one that were ready to ſleepe. And if any man did chance to tranſgreſſe this rule of quietneſſe and ſilence, they held him <hi>guilty two wayes:</hi> 1. [<hi>quòd orationis ſuae reus ſit, quòd eam videlicet negligenter offerat Deo</hi>] that hee <hi>forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fruit of his prayer, becauſe hee offered it up to God in a negligent manner:</hi> and (2.) [<hi>quòd indiſciplinato ſtrepitu, alterius quoque, qui forſitan intentiùs orare potuit, intercipit ſenſum] becauſe by a rude and unmannerly noiſe, he did diſturb the devotion of his fellow, who might have prayed
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:2455:357"/>
with more fervour.</hi> This was the ſilent reverence, that was uſed in thoſe dayes.</p>
                     <p>But, Lord, how unlike are our dayes to the former times? Men are now ſo farr from ſhewing ſuch reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their God in his Service, that they forget all civilitie and good manners to their neighbours,. Men and women, I meane, who by clapping their Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doores, and ſometimes by redoubling the knock, do ſo diſturb the Aſſembly, that neither the Miniſter can be heard, nor the people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their devotion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, the maner of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill people is, to come to Church, when ſervice is halfe ended; (for they have
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:2455:358"/>
more devotion to their beds then to their prayers:) and <hi>indiſciplinato ſtrepitu,</hi> with this <hi>rude knocking,</hi> they tell all the Congregation, that they come to ſerve GOD, when a great part of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is ended. It is pitie, but ſome diſcipline were preſently exerciſed on ſuch men and women. If a child trouble the Congregation with crying, the Nurſe cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him out of doores: if a dog diſturb them with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the Sexton laſheth him with a whipp: and if men and women, who ought to have more both diſcretion and religion, do in as rude a maner diſturb Gods ſervice, I ſee not why they ſhould go away without correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:2455:358"/>
But thoſe, which are well minded toward God and his ſervice, will I hope, upon this intimation amend it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third and laſt duty to be performed in the time of our hearing is to uſe wiſedome for fitting that which is ſaid, to our owne advantage. And for that purpoſe three rules are to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Rule.</hi> We muſt care for nothing in a Sermon, but that which may do us <hi>good to ſalvation.</hi> The proofes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Proof.</hi> The end of all preaching is the profiting of our ſoules in grace, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them by grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eternall glory. For
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:2455:359"/>
firſt God himſelfe, who is the Law-giver, profeſſeth of himſelfe; <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way, that thou ſhalt go. Iſ.</hi> 48.17. Hee meaneth, that the things which hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in his word are <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;</hi> and if men would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his direction, he would lead them in a way, that would bee for their good. 2. CHRIST our LORD, who is the great Prophet of the Church, he ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo; <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon mee; becauſe hee hath anointed mee, to preach good tidings to the meek, hee hath ſent me to bind up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted, to proclaime li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the captives, &amp;c. that
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:2455:359"/>
they may bee called trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord. Iſa.</hi> 61.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I note two things (1.) the matter of Chriſts Preaching, and that was, <hi>good tidings, the binding up of the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</hi> all which are things belonging to our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation: and (2.) the end of his Preaching; and that was, that men might become <hi>trees of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> He meaneth, that like good trees they might bee fruitfull in good works, of holineſſe, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right living. All which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie a profiting in grace and obedience: 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe preacher of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith, the ſumme and end of all his Preaching, and of mens
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:2455:360"/>
hearing, is this, <hi>Feare God and keepe his Commandements. Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, ſaith, that God <hi>ſent him to the Gentiles, to open their eyes and to turne them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive forgivenes of ſinnes, and inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are ſanctified. &amp;c. Act.</hi> 26.17, 18. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to ſave labour in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of particulars, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath told us in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that <hi>God gave</hi> to his Church, <hi>Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtours, and Teachers: and all for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt. Epheſ.</hi> 4.
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:2455:360"/>
11, 12. By this it appeareth that the end of all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the good of mens ſoules: and from hence it followeth, that therefore men in hearing the word preached, ſhould ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which may further their ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Proof.</hi> It is a ſpeciall propertie and vertue in Gods word, that it <hi>begetteth faith,</hi> and worketh grace, and doth help mens ſoules to ſalvation. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of it, that it is <hi>the power of God to ſalvation. Rom.</hi> 1.16. Where hee doth not onely ſay, that it is uſefull, but that it is <hi>powerfull</hi> to bring men to ſalvation. S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the ingraffed word is able to ſave our ſoules. Iames.</hi> 1.21.
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:2455:361"/>
where (1.) hee calleth it, <hi>the ingraffed word;</hi> meaning that the word muſt be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſetled in our heart: and (2.) hee ſaith, that <hi>it is able to ſave our ſoules,</hi> if it be thus ſetled within us. S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> alſo to the like purpoſe, <hi>Deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Where hee ſaith two things of Gods word, (1.) that it is like <hi>milk,</hi> to nouriſh Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in grace: and (2.) that if they deſire and ſuck in this milk, it will make them to <hi>grow</hi> in goodneſſe, till they become ſtrong men in Chriſt. And to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is alſo, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to his Maſter, <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternall life. Ioh.</hi> 6.
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:2455:361"/>
68: and that the Angel ſaid to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould <hi>tell him words, by which hee and all his houſe ſhould bee ſaved. Act.</hi> 11.14. And by this it appeareth, that the uſe and vertue of Gods word, is to work grace, and procure ſalvation: and hence alſo it followeth, that they who would make a right uſe of Gods word, muſt ſeek for grace and ſalvation by it.</p>
                     <p>Thus the truth of the rule is confirmed: and if it bee duly obſerved, it will recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie two errours amongſt us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Their errour, who, ſo that their eares bee tickled, and their fanſies pleaſed, do think they have gained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough by a Sermon. Of
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:2455:362"/>
ſuch men the Apoſtle did prophecie, when hee ſaid; <hi>The time will come, when men will not endure ſound doctrine: but after their owne luſts ſhall heape unto themſelves Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, having itching eares; and ſhall turne away their eares from the truth, and ſhall bee turned unto fables.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. In theſe words there are foure things ſaid of theſe men. (1.) That they would not <hi>endure ſound doctrine,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, as the former Tranſlation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it, <hi>holeſome doctrine.</hi> By which word is implied, that as that is holeſome meat, which breedeth good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and maintaineth health: ſo that is good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which nouriſheth the
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:2455:362"/>
ſoule, and preſerveth it in ſpirituall health and vigour: but ſuch doctrine theſe men <hi>would not endure.</hi> (2.) Hee ſaith of theſe men, that <hi>after their owne luſts, they would heap unto themſelves Teachers.</hi> Hee meaneth they would delight in varietie, but of ſuch onely, as pleaſed their owne palat. (3.) Hee ſaith, that theſe men would <hi>have itching eares.</hi> Hee meaneth, that as when the fleſh itch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, men take pleaſure in having it rubbed: ſo theſe delighted in ſuch ſpeeches and doctrines as fitted their owne fanſies. (4.) He ſaith, that they would <hi>turne away their eares from the truth.</hi> He meaneth they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with Gods word, ſo
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:2455:363"/>
as it is plainely delivered for their inſtruction; but ſo as it is deviſed by their owne Maſters, &amp; fanſied by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This the Apoſtle did fortell of the later times. Which prediction doth ſo ſuit with our times, that as our Saviour ſaid of an other prophecie,<note place="margin">Luk. 4.21.</note> 
                        <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears:</hi> ſo I may ſay of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>In theſe daies is this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture fulfilled</hi> among us. For now (if ever) is the time that men have <hi>itching eares,</hi> and <hi>heap to themſelves Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers after their own luſts.</hi> For ſome mens eares itch after Novelties and curioſities: &amp; if the Preacher tell them of ſome outworne antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of elder times, or ſome
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:2455:363"/>
preſent rarities in the new-found world, this will tickle them with delight; &amp; pleaſe them like the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whoſe delight was to ſpeak and heare news. And ſome mens eares itch after a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious phraſe, and fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſentences, and pretty jirks of wit: and if a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher phraſe it in good words, and flouriſh it in Rhetorik, and ſome turnings of wit; he is the man, that pleaſeth to admiration. And ſome mens eares, do itch after controverſies and queſtions of the time: and if the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher raile againſt that ſide, whom they diſlike; that is melodie to their eares, and contentment to their minds. And laſtly (to forbeare mo
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:2455:364"/>
inſtances) there bee men, whoſe eares do itch after calumnies againſt the State, and reproches againſt our Church government; and if a Preacher ſhall gird at our Ceremonies, and glance at our Biſhops, and crie out of Popiſh raggs and Reliques of Rome; this maketh their hearts to leap within them, &amp; to honor that man above his rank and without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Though otherwiſe hee bee a lewd and ſcandalous liver, yet this one vertue, as they eſteem it, ſhall cover all his other vices and ſins. No ſin can caſt him out of theſe mens grace &amp; favour; ſo he be true to the faction. But when all is done, if yee ſhould aſk any of theſe <hi>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:2455:364"/>
Hearers,</hi> what they have gained in godlines by the Sermon, which they ſo much commend; yee will finde, that they cannot give any account of any grace furthered in them, nor of any ſin maſtered or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or of any thing elſe, by which they may be bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red towards ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thoſe that feare God, and deſire their own comfort, let them hence take this rule with them, that whenſoever they are pleaſed with any paſſage in a Sermon, they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently aſk their owne ſoules, wherein that paſſage hath or may profit them in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and a godly life: And if it no way further them towards heaven, it is no way
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:2455:365"/>
worth their hearing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation. It was an <hi>itching care,</hi> &amp; not a religious mind, that made them take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that paſſage.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Rule duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved will rectifie an other errour, namely the errour of them, who, if they finde their affections warmed and their zele ſtirred up within them; though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell why or upon what ground, yet then they think they have made a good mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket that day. But this may prove a deceitfull fanſie, which had need to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. For <hi>Quintilian,</hi> a man both wiſe and well experienced in things of this kinde, hath long ſince obſerved, that among Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

                        <hi>It is the faſhion of unlearned men,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>by volubilitie of tongue, and celeritie in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to raiſe an admiration of themſelves amongſt the rude
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:2455:366"/>
multitude. A bolde face will oftentimes teach that which himſelfe doth not know; and when he hath perſwaded others, hee uſurpeth to himſelfe the praiſe of learning.—Nor</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is there any thing more eaſie, then to deceive the baſer ſort and unlearned multitude with volubility of tongue. They when they underſtand not any point, do ſo much the more admire it.</hi> Nor is it any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, if the rude multitude do miſtake in judging of a Preacher: they do ſo in matters that are more plain, and more neare to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie and apprehenſion. Wee ſee it every day, that an horne-pipe or a morrice dance, and ſuch countrey muſick, doth pleaſe the
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:2455:366"/>
common ſort more then any exact and artificial muſick can do: &amp; that thoſe ſtrokes &amp; tunes, make them to leap, &amp; friſk, which would make a ſober and ſkilfull man to laugh and deride them. And ſo in this caſe; If a Preacher be furious in his action, and fluent in his words, and vehement in exclamations, and do mouthe it out with a throng of words, which are as unable to beget notions of true religion, as they are contrary to all rules of art and right reaſon: yet the multitude do greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this muſick, &amp; dance after this pipe. By all this I meane not to diſable the gifts of any, nor to cenſure their forme of teaching, that
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:2455:367"/>
may do good to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Onely I adviſe every wiſe Chriſtian, not to eſteem of a Sermon by the delight that himſelfe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the vulgar ſort, do take in the utterance of it. And I deſire that inſteed thereof they will rather conſider, what increaſe of godlineſſe they have gained by it, or wherein they have been profited either for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and for conceving of ſome point of religion, or for amending of their ſinful life. If they give an account of ſuch ſpirituall profit to their ſoules; I hinder not, but with great reaſon they may eſteem ſuch a forme of teaching. But if they can
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:2455:367"/>
give no account of their profiting in godlineſſe; I can give no approbation of their vaine cenſures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> The ſecond rule which wiſedome requireth to be obſerved in the time of our hearing, is that wee ſelect and ſingle out ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as do more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerne our owne practice: and take more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall notice of them then of others that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern us not ſo nearly. For the mind of man is of a finite nature, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obſerve all things with like exactneſſe and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and our memories are feeble and fraile, and cannot treaſure up every thing that is ſpoken. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever ability and
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:2455:368"/>
ſtrength of minde and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory we have; wee ſhould huſband them in the beſt manner, and for our beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And ſo wee ſhall do, if paſſing by things, that bee impertinent, and ſliding through points of leſſer moment; wee faſten our minds upon ſuch leſſons and obſervations, as do more nearely concerne our ſelves. In the uſe of this rule, the Prophet hath gone before us, and ſhewed us the way. Hee being to inſtruct the Prieſts in things of their duty, beginneth with this Preface; <hi>And now, O yee prieſts, this commandement is for you. Mal.</hi> 2.1. And ſo, if the Preacher tell Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of their dutie to
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:2455:368"/>
their ſonnes and ſervants, he that is a maſter of a family, preſently ſhould ſay with himſelfe, <hi>This commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is for mee.</hi> And if the Preacher ſpeake of the duty of ſervants to their maſters; hee that is a ſervant, ſhould ſay, <hi>This commandement is for me.</hi> And if hee inſiſt on the duties of maried Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the huſband ſhould ſay, <hi>This commandement is for me;</hi> and the wife ſhould ſay, <hi>That commandement is for me.</hi> And if hee preach of true dealing in bargaining and contracts; the merchant, and the ſhop-keeper, and the Artificer, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomer, and every man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt may ſay, <hi>That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is for mee,</hi> and to
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:2455:369"/>
me it belongeth. And in a word, every one, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth any rule, that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe, ſhould make application of it to himſelfe: that that which is his for the duty, may be his for the practice alſo. Thus wee ſee all ſorts of men, that have care of their owne ſtate, do uſe to do in things of this life without any teaching. If they heare of any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, that is proper for an infirmity of their owne; that they mark, and either imprint it in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or write it up in a book of remembrance, for their after-uſe; when in the mean while they paſſe over many other better rules in their kinde, onely becauſe they
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:2455:369"/>
are not ſo proper for their caſe and condition. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if a man reade the book of Statutes, and finde a Law which concerneth his owne Lands, or his owne dealings: he will either fold downe a leafe, or mark the place in the margin, or tran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcribe the words in a note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book; that it may be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, when the time ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. And ſo, if in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word either preached or read, we meet with any leſſon or rule of life, that concerneth our ſelves in ſpeciall, we ſhould conſider wherein and how it may ſtead us: and this conſideration will bee as a mark ſet upon it, to keep it in remembrance. For if we
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:2455:370"/>
ſhould forget the rule it ſelfe, yet the very applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to our ſelves, will put us in minde of it. But as for other things, which are not uſefull and proper for us, wee may paſſe them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with leſſe care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. For example, if we heare ſome inſtruction, which wee had learned as fully before, wee may let that paſſe, as having no need of it. And if we heare ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what not uſefull for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and a godly life; wee may let that go, as not worth the noting, when bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things are in place. And if we heare good inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are uſefull for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but concerne not our ſelves; wee may diſmiſſe
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:2455:370"/>
them alſo, as not pertinent to our purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>In ſome ſuch manner as this, we may ſingle out ſuch leſſons as are proper, and paſſe by thoſe, which cannot further to a good life. And this condemneth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of two ſorts; (1.) of them that buſie themſelves about trifles, and things of no worth: and (2.) of them, who trouble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other mens duties, not pertinent to themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about trifles or frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things; and by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them do exclude things of better worth. Such are they, who are more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Miniſters
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:2455:371"/>
wearing of a cap, or a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, or an hood, then they are with their owne duty of obedience to Governours, and of juſt dealing with their neighbours, and of keeping the tongue from ſlandering and deriding of their betters. Such men, if they heare any word againſt a Ceremony, or againſt a Biſhop; they mark and mind that, and clap hands at it for joy: when they can heare threatnings againſt hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and ſelfe-love, and uncharitable cenſurings (ſins too ordinary with ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) and yet are no whit mooved at the matter. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Plutar. de Audit. pag. 43.</note>

to aſk counſell for a ſore fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: the Phyſician percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he was dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill of his conſumption; anſwered, <hi>[Non eſt tibi, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, adverſus reduviam opus medicínâ] My friend, you have no ſuch need of phyſick for a finger:</hi> it is your lungs, that may enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger your life. And ſo I may ſay to theſe men, <hi>There is no ſuch danger to your ſoules, from a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſurplice, or hood:</hi> Your danger is from your owne ſinnes, your pride, and ſelfe-love, and overweening of your ſelves, with deſpiſing of your equalls, and ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your betters, &amp;c. Cure theſe diſeaſes firſt, and then we will heare you, if ye have any thing to ſay that
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:2455:372"/>
may diſcover a fault in our Ceremonies. The concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is; They that will profit by hearing Gods word, muſt ſingle out ſuch things, as may help to amend their lives.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned alſo, who buſie themſelves about imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent matters: things which either concerne not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or are above their reach and capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. In this ſort S. <hi>Peter</hi> offended.

<pb n="697" facs="tcp:2455:372"/>
it: <hi>If I will that he tary till I come, what is that to thee? fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low thou mee. Ioh.</hi> 21.21, 22. And ſuch a one was he that would needs know, what God was a doing, before he made the world: to which buſie queſtion an ancient Father gave a wittie and wiſe anſwere, which was <hi>[Alta ſcrutantibus gehennas parabat,] hee was making hell for them that prie into his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Auguſt. Conf. lib. 11. c. 12. pag. 74.</note> And ſuch like were thoſe Monks, of whom we read, that they aſked Copres an holy and devout man, concerning <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> who and what he was: to whom <hi>Copres,</hi>

                        <hi>[tundens tertiò os ſuum] ſmiting himſelfe three times on the mouth, ſaid, [Vae tibi Copre, &amp;c.] Woe to
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:2455:373"/>
thee Copres, which neglecteſt the things, which GOD hath commanded thee to doe; and ſearcheſt after thoſe things, which he never required at thy hands.</hi> Hee meant by a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative applying of their fault to himſelfe, to tell them how dangerous it is, to be buſie about unneceſſary things. And ſo if any of us ſhall mark and enquire into the duties of other men; What the dutie of the King is in ruling of his people, what the Biſhops in orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Church, what the Miniſters in preaching of the word, or what the Magiſtrats dutie is in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of juſtice; wee may ſay to him, What is that to thee, who art a privat man? do
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:2455:373"/>
thou learn &amp; do thine own duty, and let other men alone with their places, that concerne thee not. Againe, if any man ſhall buſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the orders of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in heaven, and of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that the Saints have, one with an other in an other world: wee may bid him firſt learn what God teacheth him for his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; &amp; when he hath learned all that, then hee may have leave, to enquire about needleſſe things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Rule.</hi> The laſt rule of wiſdome in our hearing is, that if any ſin be reproved, or any judgment threatned, we ſhould bee ſuſpitious of our ſelves, leſt wee may be
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:2455:374"/>
the men: and in an holy je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, applie every thing to our ſelves, that reaſon will permit. For even in things of this life, <hi>Salves</hi> do not heale, unleſſe they bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wound; nor medicines do not cure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be received by the Patient; nor meat doth not nouriſh, unleſſe it be taken downe into the ſtomach. And ſo it is here: Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and comminations and caveats againſt ſin; they do not humble the ſinner, nor work repentance and warineſſe, unleſſe they bee applied to the diſeaſed and craſie ſoule. This is apparent in the example of <hi>David. Nathan</hi> being ſent to him to reprove him, he firſt told
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:2455:374"/>
him a parable, and under it deſcribed his ſin; but <hi>David</hi> paſſed over this, without once thinking on himſelfe, who was aimed at in that ſpeech. But when <hi>Nathan</hi> once had ſaid, <hi>Thou art the man. Thus ſaith the</hi> LORD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then <hi>David</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his fault, and ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the</hi> LORD. And ſo hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and aſked and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>David:</hi> and ſo it is, and will be with us alſo. If ſinnes be ſpoke againſt in generall onely, that worketh ſeldom times any remorſe: but applie them to the conſcience; and that worketh repentance &amp; amendment of life. Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:2455:375"/>
then is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But it may not bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that alwaies it ſhould be done by the Preacher, as here it was done by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. For ſometimes he can not do it, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the particular ſins, whereof each man is guiltie, and to be admoniſhed: and ſometimes he may not do it; becauſe, if hee ſhould point out men in the pulpit, he might rather offend the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, then amend the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; or, hee might ſhame him, rather then reforme him. Such applications by the Preacher may be uſefull in privat, as <hi>Nathans</hi> was: but what good may come by perſonating men in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik, I cannot conceive.
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:2455:375"/>
Seeing then that the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher cannot, or may not make this application: wiſe hearers muſt help him, and make the application them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If he tell them from the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13.4.</note> 
                        <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge:</hi> they, if any among them be privie to himſelf of this ſin, muſt ſay within himſelfe, <hi>I am the man,</hi> that have ſinned in this ſort, &amp; am guilty of that judgment. And if Hee preach againſt fraud and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and preſſe upon them, that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let no man overreach or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his brother in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the</hi> LORD <hi>is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6: they if guilty, ſhould ſay, <hi>I am the man,</hi> and mine
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:2455:376"/>
is that judgement. And if He preach againſt drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and good fellowſhip, and tell of that threatening of the Prophet, <hi>Wo to them that riſe up early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they may follow ſtrong drink, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue untill night, till the wine enflame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Iſa.</hi> 5.11: they ſhould ſay each man for himſelfe, I am the man: I have made the fault, and I deſerve that wo. And ſo ſhould wee do in all other the like caſes: ſtill help the Preacher, by brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that home to our ſelves; which hee ſetteth before all his Hearers, that they may pick out that which they have need of.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone through the rules; every wiſe man
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:2455:376"/>
may make uſe of them, as occaſion ſerveth: and either adde more of his own unto them, or place others that are better in their roome. God grant us of his grace, that wee may conſcionably uſe all ſuch helps, as he doth preſcribe us for our ſpiritual good: that by them, &amp; his grace accompanying them, we may in the end attaine to his glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Hee that will profit by a Sermon, ſhall do well, after the Sermon is ended, to <hi>call to mind</hi> what he hath heard, &amp; then to conſider of things more diſtinctly and with more leaſure. For in the time of our hearing, becauſe our
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:2455:377"/>
mindes muſt go along with the Preachers tongue, wee want time to pauſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and weigh what wee heare: the moſt that we can do, is but to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, which of the things delivered, may bee fit for our uſe. The hammering and the fitting of them, is left for afterward, when we may have more time to ſift and examine them more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly. This courſe wiſe men uſe to obſerve in other the like caſes. When they read things in haſte, they folde down a leaf or make a mark in the margin of the book, that they may read the place over againe at more leiſure: &amp; when the time &amp; occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerveth, they conſider of

thoſe remarkable paſſages. And ſo after we have heard the word preached or read, and have marked out for our ſelves, thoſe which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the moſt uſefull ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: it will bee profitable, to take a time to think on them againe in our privat houſes.

                     <p n="1">I. From grounds of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For in them we finde, that after S. <hi>Paul</hi> had given inſtructions to <hi>Timothy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his duty, he addeth for concluſion, <hi>Meditate on theſe things.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. <hi>&amp;, Conſider, what I ſay, and the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 2.7. And ſo <hi>David</hi> often profeſſeth of himſelfe, that his practice was to <hi>meditate</hi> on Gods word. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 119.15, 23, 48, 78, 148: and ſetteth it down
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:2455:380"/>
as a note of a bleſſed man, that hee doth <hi>meditate in the Law of the Lord.</hi> In like ſort it is ſaid of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that <hi>ſhee kept all the things</hi> that were ſpoken to her by the Shepherds, and <hi>pondered them in her heart. Luk.</hi> 2.19: and <hi>ver.</hi> 51. after our Saviours diſputing with the Doctors, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer concerning the doing of his Fathers <hi>buſineſſe;</hi> it is ſaid, that ſhe <hi>kept all theſe ſayings in her heart:</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that ſhee noted and marked them, when they were ſpoken, and afterward laid all together, &amp; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the purpoſe of God in them for mans ſalvation. By all this wee ſee, that holy men of God have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:2455:381"/>
themſelves with bare hearing &amp; reading of Gods word; but have <hi>meditated</hi> and conſidered of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with more leiſure. Now of all the times that may be imployed about this ſervice, none is more fit, then within a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our hearing. And this time is therefore moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; partly, becauſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is then moſt freſh, and beſt able to give an account of what hath beene heard; and partly, becauſe preſent meditation and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will both confirme the memory, and prepare the heart for performance in the time to come.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. There is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to bee reaped by this
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:2455:381"/>
practice. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It will better our <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and make us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things more fully and perfectly. For in hearing, many things eſcape us through haſte, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward may bee obſerved and underſtood in our ſecond and more ſerious thoughts. For example, in our hearing, while we mind the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in ſeverall, the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and connexion of the parts, do many times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip us, which upon a ſecond review (eſpecially time of conſideration being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereto) we may eaſily diſcerne; and thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more diſtinctly and fully. 2. In the Sermon or
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:2455:382"/>
in the Chapter read, there may happen ſome hard words, and dark ſentences, and deepe reaſons; which on the ſudden wee cannot, but with a little labour and meditation, we may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and diſcover. 3. There are in every Sermon lightly ſome teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſome arguments from nature and reaſon, the ſoundneſſe or emptineſſe whereof appeare not for the preſent. For light reaſons ſet foorth with fine words, and a gracefull delivery, do at the firſt pleaſe, yea, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a vulgar Hearer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they were turned out of their Rhetoricall coat, and ſhewed in their naturall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as in the rehearſing of
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:2455:382"/>
them by the Hearers, they will be;) then the vanity of them will bewray it ſelfe. And ſo on the contrary, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſound argument, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid reaſon, mooueth not the hearers, when it is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; becauſe they cannot on the ſudden dive into the depth of it; which by after thoughts they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. From whence it is, that ſome mens Sermons, ſeeme better in the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then they did at the firſt hearing; becauſe now they are better underſtood, then they were before. In theſe reſpects, whoſoever ſhall imitate the commendable example of the Bereans, who when <hi>Paul</hi> had ended his Sermon, <hi>ſearched the
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:2455:383"/>
Scriptures,</hi> weighed the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, conſidered the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and marked how every thing was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and confirmed: that man will gaine both an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his knowledge, and a confirmation of his faith, as the Bereans did; eſpecially if he meet with a ſolid Preacher, ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> was. Let this then bee the firſt benefit of <hi>recalling,</hi> what we have heard; it furthereth our knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, that it will be an help to our <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> faſtening and imprinting therein, the leſſons that were delivered. And this it will do, for theſe cauſes, and in theſe reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="717" facs="tcp:2455:383"/>(1.) The repeating of what we have heard, is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond preſenting to our minds of thoſe leſſons and inſtructions which we have heard: and the oftener they be preſented to the minde, the better they will bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened in the memory; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of the underſtanding working upon the memory alſo. And therefore, as the ſecond blow driveth the naile deeper then the firſt did; ſo this ſecond repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of things to the minde, and by the minde to the memory, will keep a better reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of what we haue learned.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) The memory is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by helped alſo, becauſe in the firſt hearing the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:2455:384"/>
points, were clothed &amp; covered (as wee may ſay) with many words of ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and enlargement: which though they had their uſe for moving of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, yet are ſome hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the memorie, which is leſſe able to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up neceſſary points, when they are cumbred with ſo many circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. But in our after thoughts, when wee conſider againe what wee have heard, wee may ſingle out the bare matter from the Rhetorick, and lay the neceſſary points by themſelves alone: and then they will not onely be contracted into a narrower roome, more eaſie for the memorie; but beſides, each
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:2455:384"/>
thing will appeare in its due order and place, which will help the memory to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that, which otherwiſe it would have forgotten. For if it ſhould forget the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, taken ſeverally and apart, yet the very depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and connexion that one thing hath with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will help to bring all to remembrance. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this reaſon, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that ſentence of the Apoſtle; <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things that we have heard, leſt at any time wee ſhould let them ſlip. Heb.</hi> 2.1. In theſe words, theſe things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for our purpoſe. (1.) When he ſaith, <hi>We muſt give earneſt heed,</hi> he meaneth
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:2455:385"/>
that wee muſt meditate and conſider with diligence and care. (2.) When hee ſaith, we muſt give heed <hi>to the things which wee have heard,</hi> he implieth, that this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of minde, and this heed that is required, is a thing that followeth after our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. We muſt [now] give heed to the things, which we have [formerly] heard. (3.) When hee ſaith, Wee muſt give heed, <hi>leſt wee let them ſlip:</hi> hee intimateth, that if we do not afterward heed what before we heard, we may quickly like leaking veſſels, let all runne out that hath beene powred into us. And therefore, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Attention</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is like the plough that
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:2455:385"/>
openeth the ground for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in of the ſeed: ſo now I may as truly ſay, that <hi>Meditation</hi> and recalling of what wee have heard, is like the Harrow, which breaketh the clods, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the ſeed ſowen, that it may bee kept from the fowles of the aire, that would eat it up. Thus this ruminating of what we have heard, helpeth to confirme the <hi>memorie:</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance is ſo neceſſary for our profiting by the word; that without it all is loſt, that was gained by our hearing. He that forgetteth what he hath heard, is like a man, that <hi>earneth wages,</hi> and <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them into a broken bagge:</hi> or like one with a weak ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:2455:386"/>
who caſteth up his meat, as ſoone as hee hath taken it in: that is, all of them take paines without profit; becauſe they keep not what they have gotten. The concluſion is, if wee meane to profit by our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, wee muſt recall what we have heard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> But ſome perhaps will ſay, that their memories are <hi>fraile,</hi> and they cannot call to minde that which they have heard: when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they can remember nothing, or nothing to any purpoſe, that the Preacher did ſay.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> To theſe men I have three things to ſay.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) That men &amp; women
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:2455:386"/>
moſt times do laie the blame upon their memories, when indeed the fault is in their own <hi>negligence</hi> and careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For even thoſe men, who complaine of weak me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, yet when they have made a bargaine, can relate all the paſſages; and if they heare a plaie or an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, they can tell by heart the merie jeſts contained in it; &amp; if ye tell them a ſtory of their forefathers kinred, and their noble deſcent, this they can repeat over with readineſſe and perfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and if ye ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to a treaſure, that laie hid in a field, they would neither forget the place, nor the way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to it. Only, when they
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:2455:387"/>
heare inſtructions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heaven and ſalvation, Here their memories faile them: and they can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing. And what can bee the reaſon hereof, but that their care of heaven is leſſe then their care of the world? <hi>Tullie,</hi> when ſome objected, that olde age was forgetfull, anſwered, <hi>[Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia quae curant, ſenes memine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,] Olde men do remember al that they care for:</hi> never did any of them forget, where he laied his money, or what bargaine hee had made. And ſo I may ſay of theſe men, <hi>[Omnia quae curant, meminerunt,]</hi> they do not forget any thing that they care for: their money, their bargains, their pleaſures;
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:2455:387"/>
theſe things they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and if they forget the inſtructions of GODS word alone, it is a ſhrewd argument, that they care but a little for them. Let them amend their affection to godlineſſe and Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and then their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will everie day grow better, and will bee as able to remember the things of God, as now they are to remember the things of the world.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) I ſay, It is true, that all mens memories are not alike good. For ſome mens memories are ill diſpoſed by nature, others are weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſickneſſe or olde age, &amp; others are deaded through intemperance and ill diet.
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:2455:388"/>
And if any man be diſabled by theſe or any other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo that indeed hee cannot remember, what he doth heare; I muſt needs ſay that man wanteth a great help to godlineſſe, which others do enjoy. But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if he do his endevour, both for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of his memorie, and for recalling to minde, that which hee hath heard; hee may comfort himſelf in this, that our God, whom wee ſerve, is gratious, and will not require more of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, then hee hath made them able to performe. But as the Apoſtle ſaid of libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and almſdeeds, <hi>If there be a willing minde, it is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to that which a
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:2455:388"/>
man hath, and not according to that which hee hath not.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12: So it is true of all duties and good perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; if there be a <hi>willing minde</hi> ſo that we performe what we are able to do, God accepteth of our endevours, though they be weak and poore in the performance. And therefore he or ſhe who complaineth of a weak me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, ſhould firſt take care, that the defect be not in his own negligence or diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carriage; as namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee did not attend, when hee did heare; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee doth not rubb up his memorie, and call it to account, after he hath heard; or becauſe hee did or doth entertaine idle thoughts of
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:2455:389"/>
by-buſineſſes, when hee ſhould minde the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were given him. And if the defect be not in himſelfe, hee may comfort himſelfe in GODS mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which is nor denied to them, who endevour to ſerve God in ſinceritie and truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) I ſay, It may be that a tender conſcience may in this caſe think worſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then there is cauſe. For perhaps he remembreth not the words, but hee can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the matter, and ſpeak of it in a ruder phraſe of his owne; or perhaps he cannot remember any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceſſe concerning the matter, but yet he can tell, that ſuch a ſin was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:2455:389"/>
and ſuch a duty enjoyned, by which he is perſwaded to ſerve GOD better; or perhaps againe, when he beginneth to think, nothing will come to his minde, &amp; yet if one ſhould queſtion him concerning this or that point handled in the Sermon, or, if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhould have occaſion to practice it in his courſe of life; he could then call to minde, that he had heard it and can tell now how to make uſe of it. And if there be but thus much, it is not to be accounted as nothing. Tender conſciences, who diſquiet themſelves with feares for their diſabilitie of memorie, may conſider of a ſtorie related in the lifes

And then the old father replied, So, my ſon, is the ſoule which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes heareth Gods word: though it remember not, what it hath heard, yet it is more cleanſed from ſin, then that ſoule that never came to heare</hi> at all. And ſo, if any man or woman among us have a weak memorie, and cannot give ſo good an account of a Sermon, as others can do; they muſt doe their ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to amend their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and if ſtill they come ſhort and faile of their deſire, yet they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves with this thought, that all is not quite loſt, but ſomwhat ſticketh in the minde, which though
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:2455:391"/>
it appear not at the preſent, yet may do them good for afterward; as the veſſel, into which the water was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was cleaner &amp; moiſter, then that which ſtood drie, without any water powred into it at all. The concluſion of this point is, Let men do their hearty endevour, and not frame excuſes of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when it is their owne idleneſſe and want of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the work: and then I dare ſay, that no mans or womans memorie is ſo bad, but though they cannot make any orderly repetiti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of their hearing, yet ſomewhat is laied up in them, which when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered, will ſhew it ſelf, and may direct them
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:2455:391"/>
by a holy life to eternall glory. And thus much for the ſecond benefit, which is the <hi>helping of memory</hi> or remembrance.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third is, Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling to minde after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, what we heard in the Sermon-time, will bee a meanes to better our <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and will enable us to fee, what paſſages are uſeful and profitable for a godly life. For if wee think, that every paſſage in a Sermon doth alike profit us, as it doth pleaſe us, wee greatly deceive our ſelves. For in common experience we ſee, that fine and well ſhaped clothes, put upon a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen body do make him ſeeme more handſome to
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:2455:392"/>
a vulgar eie, then the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt man, that is clothed in rags. And ſo elegancie of phraſe, and cadencie of ſentences, and lively expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the minde, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being graced with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of geſture alſo (which things are the ornaments and the attire of a Sermon;) do uſually more cary away the eares and hearts of the vulgar, then ſound rules and ſolid reaſons poſſibly can do. But now, if a man would know, which of the two is the more perſonable and better proportioned man, hee muſt ſtrip them both out of their clothes, and then hee ſhall ſee them ſuch as indeed they be. And ſo, if our Hearers would
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:2455:392"/>
know what is ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall in our Sermons, they muſt turne them out of their attire of utterance and eloquence: and then they may ſee what profitable notes they containe, that may further a godly life. If there be any thing that may ſerve either to reforme our manners, or to make us wiſer to ſalvation: that is ſound doctrine. But all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words or things, that ſome way or other further not this end, they are either but empty ſhews, or at the beſt but externall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if thus men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to trie and examine the goodneſſe of a Sermon; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more fit for that purpoſe, then is Repetition
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:2455:393"/>
and after-conſideration of what wee have heard. For then and at ſuch a time, the matter and ſubſtance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines debated, will offer themſelves with eaſe to a faithfull memorie; when the outward ornaments of eloquence and geſture will faile us, do what wee can. And ſo, hereby we ſhall bee enabled to ſee each limme, and each joint, and each ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of a Sermon, in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and and proper ſhape; ſo our ſelves bee carefull to view and conſider the parts thus diſſected, and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the view.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome perhaps will ſay. What? and do yee then condemne or debaſe eloquence and action, the
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:2455:393"/>
gracefull vertues of an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> I anſwere no, in no wiſe. I commend them and reckon them as grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ornaments, that ſerve to beautifie true doctrine, as I would commend hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome clothes that adorne a mans body. For as comely clothes put upon a well-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured perſon, do make him more lovely and amiable to the Beholders; ſo eloquence and utterance, when they do attend and wait upon ſound doctrine, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the Hearers, and may induce them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. This I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to be true, ſo to be a great vertue in a Sermon. But yet I would have men
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:2455:394"/>
wiſe to diſtinguiſh between the clothes and the perſon of a man; or elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne his ability for each ſervice. And ſo, much rather do I deſire that Chriſtians ſhould put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene ſubſtance of doctrine and ornament of ſpeech, the one being that which putteth life of grace into his actions, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely that which may moove him to go on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in his way. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, If any would judge throughly of a Sermon, hee muſt do by it, as the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> did by the <hi>Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale.</hi> Hee having caught the bird alive, thought hee had gotten a fine diſh of meat, but when hee had ſtript her
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:2455:394"/>

And ſo, when the feathers are pulled off, it may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whether in a ſweet tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sermon there bee any thing elſe, beſide a pleaſant voice. And thus I have done with this duty of recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſefull things after our hearing.</p>

And in this kinde there are three duties to be obſerved.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="741" facs="tcp:2455:395"/>I. The firſt is, that we be <hi>reall,</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantiall,</hi> in all our performances, and not any where, <hi>perfunctory</hi> or formall; when wee have to deale with God, an outſide will not ſerve the turne: he requireth the heart, and will accept of no ſervice, which is not ſincere and hearty. And that our ſervices in this buſineſſe may bee ſuch, wee muſt obſerve two rules.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Rule.</hi> Wee muſt not think it inough to do the outward works, wee muſt joine true &amp; hearty <hi>affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> with them. For all outward acts, are but as the ſhell, or the rinde, which covereth and preſerveth the fruit from violence and harme: the inward affection of the
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:2455:396"/>
ſoule, that is the kernell and the fruit of devotion. Now the ſhell and rinde though they bee of good uſe, while they incloſe the fruit, yet are they vaine, and of no worth or moment, when they are ſeparated from it, and ſtand alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And ſo it is with acts of Gods ſervice: if they be joyned with inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart, they both ſerve to expreſſe a godly zele and to increaſe it: but if they bee disjoyned from hearty affections, they ſerve for no more uſe, then an empty ſhell and the bare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of an apple: that is, for nothing but either for the fire or the dunghill. From hence it is that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:2455:396"/>
condemneth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball prayers of the Heathen. <hi>When yee pray</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>uſe not vaine repetitions, as the Heathen do: for they think they ſhall bee heard for their much ſpeaking. Matt.</hi> 6.7. In which words, our LORD ſetteth out the vitious pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Heathen by two things: (1.) by their <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity</hi> of words: and (2.) by their <hi>vacuitie</hi> of matter. Their <hi>ſuperfluitie</hi> of words was, that they uſed much ſpeaking and vaine repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that is, they prayed at length, while words were at hand; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> new words fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they went over their prayers againe. (2.) their <hi>vacuity</hi> or emptineſs of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in theſe many words, is
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:2455:397"/>
deſcribed two wayes. (1.) In that it is ſaid, they uſed <hi>vaine repetitions.</hi> The word in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is, to <hi>ſpeak as Battus</hi> did: and his manner of ſpeech is ſet out by the Poet to bee this: when one aſked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any cattell were driven that way, <hi>Battus</hi> in the Poet is ſaid to make anſwere, that there were, and <hi>[ſub illis Montibus, inquit, erant, &amp; era<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſub montibus illis] they went under thoſe mountaines, and under thoſe mountaines they went;</hi> idly repeating, what before hee had ſaid, which was fooliſh in the Speaker, and tedious to the Hearer. (2.) The <hi>emptineſſe</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in thoſe prayers is ſet out by another word, not
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:2455:397"/>
much unlike to the former; <gap reason="foreign">

For if a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his ſpeech long, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, when hee <hi>continued till midnight.

                        </gap>, <hi>a man of many words:</hi> then onely is a man ſaid to uſe many words, when the words are moe, then the matter doth require. And therefore the former Tranſlation did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place not unfitly, when it ſaid, <hi>They think to bee heard for their much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> The fault then taxed in theſe Heathens was, that

they uſed <hi>emptie</hi> words without matter and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anſwerable thereunto.

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> In duties of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and repeating, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, we muſt not reſt in the preſent work, or the <hi>tranſient act</hi> of theſe duties; as if we performed a ſervice to God, becauſe wee <hi>heare,</hi> and <hi>rehearſe,</hi> and talk of a Sermon: but wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to future practice, and eſteeme them onely ſo farre forth good, as they make us better; either wiſer
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:2455:399"/>
in our knowledge, or holier in our obedience. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that the Prophet deſcribing the nature of right hearing, ſaith,<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.23</note> 
                        <hi>Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you will give eare to this? who will hearken and heare for the time to come?</hi> In which words, (1.) when he ſaith, <hi>who will</hi> giue eare, and <hi>who will hearken?</hi> hee implieth that all ſhould, but yet few do ſo; and (2.) when he ſaith, <hi>who will heare for the time to come?</hi> hee meaneth that men ſhould not content themſelves with the tranſient action of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which continueth no longer, then while the ſound laſteth; but they muſt ſo heare for the preſent, that it may ſerve for afterward:
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:2455:400"/>
namely, that they think on it, and conſider of it, and put it in practice as occaſion ſhall require. This is to <hi>heare for afterward:</hi> but if any, while he heareth, have ſome warme affections kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in him, and after hee is gone, think no more on it, or amendeth not his life by it; this man heareth onely for the preſent, and doth not anſwere Gods expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when hee ſaith, <hi>who will heare for the time to come?</hi> And ſo in like ſort, if a man note Sermons with his pen, and repeat them afterward with his familie, and yet for moſt part inſiſteth upon empty words and idle alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him or them in godlines,
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:2455:400"/>
and neglecteth thoſe notes, which might make them better: this mans writing and repeating are both alike of no value. But if further any ſhall abuſe theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes to countenance their factious meetings, and inſtead of meditating on Gods word, do deviſe ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt Gods Church; theſe men turne duties of religion into occaſions of ſinne. Let not my pen ever ſpeak any word for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in ſuch an evill practice. The ſumme of all is, that if wee will proove our ſelves to bee good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Gods word, we muſt ſo heare, and ſo repeat, and ſo performe every duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this work; as that
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:2455:401"/>
all of them may further us in Gods ſervice and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The ſecond <hi>generall</hi> duty is, that together with our owne endevours and performances, wee joyne <hi>prayer</hi> to God for his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the work that we go about. For as <hi>David</hi> ſaid in a like caſe, <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vaine that build it;</hi> and, <hi>except the Lord keepe the City, the watchman waketh but in vaine. Pſal.</hi> 127.1: ſo, except God aſſiſt us with his grace, wee ſhall prepare our ſelves in vaine, and heare Gods word in vaine, and what wee have heard, wee ſhall repeat in vaine: and nothing that wee go about,
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:2455:401"/>
either before, or after, or while we heare; can proſper, unleſſe God give the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and make it to proſper. Now the bleſſing of God is to bee ſought and obtained by prayer. S. <hi>Iames</hi> his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is, <hi>If any man lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall bee given him. Iam.</hi> 1.5. In this Scripture wee have firſt a precept, directing us to our duty, <hi>If any man lack wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let him ask of God:</hi> and ſecondly a promiſe, aſſuring us of ſucceſſe, <hi>and it ſhall bee given him:</hi> and thirdly, a reaſon drawen from Gods nature, <hi>Hee giveth liberally to all, and hee upbraideth no man</hi> with his gifts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:2455:402"/>
he will be ready to give us that which we want, if we beg it of him in our prayers. And ſo, if any man lack (and who lacketh not?) either a prepared minde before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or due attention in the time of hearing, or a firme memory after hearing, let him aſk of God, who giveth liberally: and he needs not doubt but God will give what he doth aſk according to Gods will. Upon this ground<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 10. cap. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Caſsian</hi> an ancient &amp; Learned Writer, adviſeth men, upon every occaſion to make uſe of that praier of <hi>David, [Deus in adjuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium meum intende: Domine, ad juvandum me feſtina.] O</hi> GOD <hi>make ſpeed to ſave me: O</hi> LORD <hi>make haſte
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:2455:402"/>
to helpe mee. Pſal.</hi> 70.1. For this praier fitteth every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man, as he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in many particulars, the ſumme whereof may bee this. If a man be in any <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe</hi> or danger, then hee ſhould ſay, <hi>Deus in adjuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, &amp;c. O God make ſpeed to ſave mee: O Lord make haſte to helpe me.</hi> And if hee be ſollicited by any <hi>tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then he ſhould pray, <hi>O God make ſpeed to ſave me, &amp;c.</hi> And if he <hi>want</hi> any grace or bleſſing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould pray, <hi>O God, make ſpeed to ſave me, &amp;c.</hi> And if hee have <hi>obtained</hi> any bleſſing or favor from God; for the continuance of that mercie, and his right uſing of it, hee ſhould pray, <hi>O God make ſpeed to ſave mee;
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:2455:403"/>
O Lord make haſte to helpe me.</hi> And what ſoever the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee, ſtill this praier will bee ſeaſonable and uſefull. Thus this holy man teacheth us, how to obſerve that rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. This direction is applicable to this purpoſe. When we are preparing to heare GODS word, we ſhould pray God, that hee will prepare our hearts, and fit us for that ſervice; when wee are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied in the act of hearing, we ſhould pray, that GOD will direct us to lay hold on that which we finde uſefull for us; &amp; after our hearing, we ſhould pray, that GOD will bleſſe our memories, to keepe the good leſſons,
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:2455:403"/>
which we have heard. This to bee a laudable cuſtome, ſtill to begg a bleſſing of God upon every endevour of ours; no man, I ſuppoſe, will denie: onely perhaps ſome man may doubt, how a man may pray in the time of his hearing, without hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering or interrupting the publik and enjoyned exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, then certainely more neceſſary, then any privat prayers or devotions. To this my anſwere is, that the Scripture it ſelfe, doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently direct us herein. There we read, that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> when the King was talking and conferring with him, about the affaires of his people, and the ſtate of the holy Land; yet ſaith

                        <pb n="756" facs="tcp:2455:405"/>
of himſelfe, <hi>So I prayed to the God of Heaven: and I ſaid to the King; If it pleaſe the King, &amp;c. Neh.</hi> 2.4, 5. By this wee ſee that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> at the ſame time did both pray God for a bleſſing, and continue his ſpeech with the King: which ſheweth, that while hee was talking with the King about thoſe weightie affaires of the Church, he darted up a ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory ſhort prayer unto God, either that hee would direct the Kings heart for the good of his people, or that he would proſper the buſineſſe in hand, or ſome ſuch prayer to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And hence wee have direction in this caſe. When we heare an uſefull point,
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:2455:405"/>
that concerneth us much, wee may by a ſhort prayer, <hi>deſire Gods bleſsing upon it, for our good,</hi> without hindering or diverting away our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from any part of the Sermon. For example, if the Preacher commend any neceſſary duty unto us, we may pray for grace, to perform it: if he condemne any ſin, by which we may be enſnared, we may pray for ſtrength to avoid it: and if hee diſpute of any hard point, which is profitable to be knowen, wee may pray for wiſdome to underſtand it. And all this wee may do without any hinderance to the publick ſervice or the exerciſe in hand. Nay, if we do thus at convenient
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:2455:406"/>
times, and when the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth require it; it will further us in that work two waies: (1.) it will obtaine a bleſſing of GOD upon the preſent work, that it may do us the more good: and (2.) it will ſeaſon our hearts with holy affections, and thereby prepare them for the performing of what they have beene taught. Prayer then is uſefull at all times, both before we come to heare, and when wee are in hearing, and after we have made an end of the work: and therefore my exhortation ſhall be that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Pray without ceaſing;</hi> and that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour where hee ſaith, that men <hi>ought alwayes to pray.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 18.1.</note>

                        <pb n="759" facs="tcp:2455:406"/>For our better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which duty, wee may conſider the ſucceſſe and event thereof, in two knowen examples. The firſt is the example of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>while hee was praying in his houſe, an Angel</hi> from heaven <hi>appeared unto him,</hi> and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him to <hi>Peter, who would tell him what hee ought to do. Act.</hi> 10.6: or, as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 11.14. <hi>would tell him words, whereby both hee and all his houſe ſhould be ſaved.</hi> An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example wee have in <hi>Saul,</hi> afterward called <hi>Paul:</hi> Of whom wee reade, that after JESUS had appeared unto him by the way, and preached unto him the ſum of the Goſpel, <hi>hee went into
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:2455:407"/>
the City, and continued three dayes faſting and praying</hi> And then the Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Ananias</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Ariſe—and inquire in the houſe of Iudas for one called Saul of Tarſus: for behold he prayeth. Act.</hi> 9.11. Where (1.) wee may note a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nias; Ariſe, go, enquire for Saul:</hi> it is a ſhort ſpeech in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding more in the ſenſe, then appeareth in the words. Hee meaneth, that hee ſhould <hi>inquire</hi> for him, and having found him, ſhould ſay and do unto him as afterward is expreſſed ver. 17. (2.) a reaſon, which moved God to beſtow theſe favours upon him, and that is in theſe words; <hi>For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:2455:407"/>
he prayeth.</hi> If <hi>Saul</hi> had gone his way, and neglected the viſion that hee ſaw, and the words that hee heard from our Saviours mouth, hee might have continued without any further directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and help. But now that hee prayed to God after the viſion and the inſtructions of our LORD;<note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 9.17. and Act. 21.14, 15, 16</note> God ſendeth his ſervant, who both <hi>opened his eyes,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in the faith, and <hi>baptized</hi> him, and <hi>layed his hands upon him;</hi> and <hi>hee was filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The application from theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to our ſelves is this: If we ſet our ſelves to <hi>prayer</hi> before hearing, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did; and by <hi>prayer</hi> beg Gods bleſſing after we have heard,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:2455:408"/>
as <hi>Saul</hi> did; wee may hope, that God<note n="(b)" place="margin">Eph. 2.4.</note> who is <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> and ſuch a one<note n="(c)" place="margin">Pſal. 65.2.</note> as <hi>heareth prayer,</hi> will bleſſe our endevours, and proſper his ordinance, and ſend us ſuch Teachers, as may direct us the right way to ſalvation and life.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The laſt <hi>generall</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, that wee bee conſtant in our performances, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be to bee uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or after, or amidſt our hearing. And by conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in our duties, I meane two things: (1.) that wee muſt not do them by ſpurts: and (2.) that wee muſt not do them by halves. 1. We muſt not do them by <hi>ſpurts</hi> onely, and when the toy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us; but wee muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:2455:408"/>
them uſually at the accuſtomed and convenient times. For thoſe that come to Church now and then, at their beſt leiſure, and now and then prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and now and then recall to minde what they have heard; are like trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andly boies, which come to ſchoole one day, and ſtay away another. Among ſuch ſchollars, I have ſeldome ſeene any, that ever learned his book to any purpoſe. And no marvell. For firſt he loſeth a great part of the time in idleneſſe, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſtow at their book, and miſſeth many leſſons, which his fellows do learne in his abſence. 2. Such a trewandly boy is not diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:2455:409"/>
to learne, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſchoole; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his minde is upon his miching holes, where hee uſeth to lurk, or upon the paſtime that hee hath ſpent his time in: and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the loſing of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary leſſons in his abſence, doth rob him of much help, that hee might have gained for the leſſons which come after. For one leſſon well learned, is a ſtepp and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to another; becauſe there is a connexion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance among rules of the ſame Art. But ſurely, what ever the reaſon bee, the concluſion is true, that a trewandly boy never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a learned man. And the ſame may bee obſerved
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:2455:409"/>
in the ſchoole of Chriſt. Thoſe that come by fits on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heare, and repeat, and conſider, when they have little elſe to do, loſe many good notes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which others who are more diligent, do learne, and ſuffer many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of minde, when they are about the work, and are every way indiſpoſed for learning of Gods Law. <hi>Thomas</hi> by being once ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when CHRIST ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to his diſciples, loſt a great meaſure of faith, which they gained who were preſent. Our LORD ſhewed them his hands and his ſide, and uſed arguments of perſwaſion to convince them of the truth of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:2455:410"/>
and they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it: but <hi>Thomas</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe grounds of faith, remained faithleſſe in that great point of our LORDS reſurrection, as is expreſſed at large, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. And ſo, hee that is abſent, when hee ſhould not, may chance miſſe of thoſe inſtructions, which might do him good to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and he that neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to uſe the meanes of profiting, when hee hath faire opportunity for them; may loſe that aſſiſtance of grace, that might guide him in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Conſequently hee that is carefull to thrive in grace, muſt <hi>continue</hi> in well doing, and not do good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by <hi>ſpurts,</hi> and as his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:2455:410"/>
leadeth him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hee that will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, muſt not do his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by <hi>halves.</hi> So they do who in their private exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, do out of idleneſſe, and indevotion, curtall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviat either their prayers, or their meditations, or any other uſefull exerciſe. But more eſpecially they do ſo, who at times of publike Service, do come, when part thereof is paſt, or go away before all bee ended. Such men runne into a twofold danger: one, that they do offend God by ſleighting of his ſervice; and the other, that they may loſe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which uſually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth the time of divine Service.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="768" facs="tcp:2455:411"/>1. They may anger God by a ſleight eſteeme of his Service. For ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>Curſed be hee, that doth the work of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, and curſed be he, that keepeth back his ſword from blood. Ier.</hi> 48.10. In this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence wee have two things. (1.) A Commination of judgement: and (2.) an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to the preſent occaſion. The Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this, <hi>Curſed be he, that doth the work of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully;</hi> the former Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation readeth it, <hi>negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> The meaning is in both, the ſame. For he that doth Gods work <hi>negligently,</hi> doth do it <hi>deceitfully</hi> alſo; becauſe he giveth God but one part of his due, and keepeth
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:2455:411"/>
back an other part from him; or for that hee gives him a worſe thing inſtead of a better. In which ſenſe hee is ſaid to bee a <hi>deceiver,</hi> who <hi>having a male in his flock, voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing. Mal.</hi> 1.14. And in this maner <hi>Saul</hi> was a <hi>deceiver,</hi> when being commanded to kill all the Amalekites, hee ſaved ſome of the beſt of them alive. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. And ſo <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were <hi>deceivers,</hi> when having offered to God all the money that the land was ſold for, they kept back part for themſelves. And in the ſame ſenſe may every one among us be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>deceiver,</hi> who giveth God a part of his ſervice, and
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:2455:412"/>
keepeth from him ſome o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther part: or, who affoord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him part of the time, that is due to his worſhip, and depriveth him of the reſt. Such a one is both a <hi>negligent</hi> workman, and a <hi>deceitfull</hi> dealer with God. 2. The application of this threatning in the Prophet is this, <hi>And curſed be hee that keepeth back his ſword from blood.</hi> The meaning is, that God had now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a work to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed againſt his enemies, the Moabites; which was to ſlay, and kill, and deſtroy them: and he that did not ſlay and deſtroy them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, was hee that did this work of the LORD both <hi>negligently</hi> and <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
                        <pb n="771" facs="tcp:2455:412"/>
though he ſhould pill, and poll, and impoveriſh them. The like application of this generall rule is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this occaſion alſo. The hearing of Gods word, with the other duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, are GODS work, which hee requireth to be done in their time and ſeaſon: and if any man do willingly and unneceſſarily withdraw himſelfe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part, when hee oweth to God the whole; hee doth Gods work deceitfully, and may feare the curſe, that is denounced againſt decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Prophet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe men, who think to pleaſe God with a part of his due either comming too late to his Service, or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:2455:413"/>
from it too ſoone, do runne upon this danger, that by their abſence they may loſe that bleſſing, which GOD hath appointed for that part of the ſervice wherein they had no ſhare. More particularly they may miſſe that prayer, by which they might have obtained the aſſiſtance of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or they may miſſe the reading of that Chapter which might have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to God from ſome evill way, or they may miſſe that paſſage in the Sermon, which might have done them good all their life long. In reſpect whereof, as he that commeth too late to his dinner, or is called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before his time, may
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:2455:413"/>
chance to riſe hungry or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied: ſo they that come too late, or depart too ſoone from divine Service, may go away deſtitute of that bleſſing of God which might nouriſh their ſoules with grace to eternall life. Hee therefore that will be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable hearer of Gods word, muſt not careleſſely neglect any part of Gods ſervice: wherein wee may take for our paterne the example of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a man much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Scriptures. He, expecting the comming of S. <hi>Peter, who ſhould tell him what he ſhould do;</hi> did in the meane while, <hi>call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his kinſmen and neare friends,</hi> and they altogether <hi>waited</hi> for the Preacher: and
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:2455:414"/>
when <hi>Peter</hi> was come to preach the Goſpel unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Wee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cornelius) are all here preſent before God, to heare all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee of God. Act.</hi> 10.24, 33. Where (1.) when it is ſaid, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> had gathered and <hi>called together his kinſmen and neare friends;</hi> wee may hence gather, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> thought it a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benefit, which he deſired his chiefe friends might be partakers of, to heare the word of God preached by the Apoſtle. (2.) When <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Wee are all here preſent to heare,</hi> hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to underſtand, that all the <hi>Hearers</hi> were preſent and met together, to wait for the Preacher before the
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:2455:414"/>
Preacher came: there was not one, that came tardie, or after the exerciſe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. (3.) When hee ſaith, wee are all here preſent, <hi>to heare all things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God</hi> to be ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; he implieth that they meant not to loſe or miſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeech: there was not a man among them all, that meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part before all was ended. The like affection and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhould be ſhewed by every Chriſtian. It is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of little devotion and reſpect to Gods ſervice, when we come ſlowly, and go away quickly, and think every houre too much, that is beſtowed in this duty. But if wee bee ready afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:2455:415" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſtay till the full end, and hearken to every thing that God hath ſent his ſervant to tell us; as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his friends did: then wee may hope, that as <hi>the holy Ghoſt fell upon them, that then heard the word, verſ.</hi> 44: ſo God will give us his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to guide us in the truth, and to lead us by a holy life, to eternall glory: Which God grant for CHRISTS ſake. Amen.</p>
